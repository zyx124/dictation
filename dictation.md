The fertile/ plains alongside of the yellow river, cradled ancient Chinese civilization. But the floods of the yellow river has killed millions of people, earning the nickname of China's Sorrow. Small particles in the water called sediment can clog in the river forcing the water spill out onto land. It was one of the most sediment-laden river in the world. Previous /models /couldn't decount for how much sediment yellow river carries. A new model more accurately described sediment transport in the water // which could help scientists predict and prevent floods. Researchers used a 3D scanner to peer through the muddy river and map on the river's bottom and when they turn on the scanner, what they saw was so unexpected, they saw the equipment was broken the bottom of the yellow river was flat. The bottom of most river like Mississippi has underwater /dunes/ that rob energy from the water limiting how much forces available to push sediment downstream. On the flat riverbed more of the river's energy can sweep particles along. Additional tests  shown that yellow river has much finer sediments than other rivers . THe particles can staytes and suspended in the water rather than sinking. These factors let the river dump more than a billion tons of sediments into the sea each year. More than 600 million tons . are deposited. along the way. The team's new model explains how the yellow river can carry so much sediment they say it could also explain other types of sediment systems from erroding coast line to antartic /glaciers/ to the martianshing plains, and predicting when and where sediment buildup might causing flooding to help scientists to protect 80 million people living alongside the yellow river banks.

B are actually translated of bowl or bulb homes, which was built in 1984 by Dutch artist and sculptor Dries Krejikamp. It was created  and  supported by a subsidy from Dutch government for experimental housing projects. Inside the houses are three levels: bedrooms on the ground and bathrooms on the middle, living space on the top. Although these homes look out of this world, their attention was to bring its inhabitants closer to nature. The round windows allow views of the outside environment from almost any angle and the complex itself in positioned near scenic canal. The designer .passed away. in 2014 however his legacy lives on  as these homes are still lived today.

Open up your wallet, you expect to find ones, tens twenties and maybe a hundo. THe last thing that you'd ever expect is a Tom, also known as a 2 dollar bill. Here is why. In 1862, the federal Government has just print its first paper money, the first and the only denominations were the 1 dollar and 2 dollar bills and keep in mind that people were making about 15 dollars a month. To pay using a 2 dollar bill is the status of symbol on the wealthiest Americans could afford. And a lot of times, they used them for under the  table transactions like /political/ bribe and prostitutes and gambling. The Tom ultimately got a bad /rap/ and was deemed unnecessary. In 1966, government took a ten year /hiatus and stop printing those bad boys. But in 1976, the government gave them another try, this time classing them up a bit, issuing a special /bicentennial bill. A little too classy, some would argue. people began in hiding them away as collector's items , leading to less bill in circulation, which brings us in present day, though rare Toms are still being printed and there are over a billing in circulation. Most people keep them as /keepsakes, thouth there is a  subculture of 2 dollar ambassadors who were set keeping the Tom alive and using them every chance they get. So the next time you pay a cash, go ahead and use a Tom.

If you are afraid of coming down and going and swimming in the ocean because of sharks you should be terrified to make a piece of toast. 400 people died last year from defective toasters where there are less than 10 did from sharks. This is the first large shark expedition like this in the western gulf. We will be tagging hammerheaded sharks, tiger sharks and Mako sharks, trying to understand how they /are leveraging/ the gulf and their /birthing,/ mating and full migratory patterns. We will be getting up everyday just before dawn, the fishing team will be going out getting all of our lines rigged and ready to go. And we will get the ship in position with lift in the water and we are gonna looking to capture, bring the shark back to the lift, lifting them out of the water, once we do that, a whole team of scientist from half dozen institutions will circle around the shark and we are going to conduct 12 reseach projects in about 15 minutes then release the shark to the open sourse the tracking to the world so that everyone can follow it. What we are finding is that these massive sharks have huge huge movements across the ocean and we have one of these sharks Lydia has travelled over 35 000 miles in just 2 years, very very regular for these sharks to be swimming thousands of miles a month, which is why so important to figure out where they go. We are losing 200,000 sharks a day for shark fin soup-- hundred million a year.And people need to understand, an ocean with no shark means the ocean with no fish. They are the lion and balance keeper of the ocean and if they are not the whole food chain collapses. THis is a simple battle, we've gotta solve the puzzles the sharks' lives to make sure they flourish and make a difference for the future.

At NY's American Museum of Natural History, we are past the Roosevelt Atrium, through the Frick building and tucked away behind the /drawers/ of bones. Dr. Jack Tsengis hard at worked. He is a dog guy. Well I have worked on dog revolution and dog/ fossil/ for about 10 years. Jackson is the man when it /comes/  dog revolution. He says dogs have a /shot at outliving/ living us all. 
Humans have been evolving for roughly three million years but dogs have been around way longer. And that history goes all the way back 40 million years. It hasn't been easy, they have dealt with warming, cooling and iceage. To determine how dogs /are goint to fare/ as the world changes, you have to start in the past because dogs are evolutionary marvels. The first dogs weren't really dogs as we know them today they were /tree-dwellers/ and really small. They changed to survive: their legs lengthen so that they can run longer distances and they grew a lot. During the ice age the big wolves weight around 140 pounds but it is their teeth that are really the key to their survival. Their teeth are getting stronger to deal with the larger bones and grit /that they make in your mouth/ when they are hunting. What he says is that it is biological that the dogs are eating machines. Think of their teeth as the basic blueprint as they goes back 40 million years and can be adapted to any kind of environmental change. THe teeth in the back crush bone. Those teeth in the middle are for cutting and the front teeth are for puncturing. What is more, dogs' teeth have reinforced surfaces, that means their teeth will stay intack whether they are eating larger bones or chewing /up/ carcasses. It also means dogs do not really need us. Dogs are able to survive even if we are no longer around to feed them because they can eat pretty much anything that comes their way. If we do go and they are left, I am sure that they will adapt whatever environment comes their way.

That is a terrible thing to do with a beer. All that delicious malty goodness gone to waste. But why should tap on top trigger a foam explosion while clink on the side  signals the start/ of a/ drink with friends? It has to do with shake with a beer bottle. When you bonk the beer bottle on top, the hit creates pressure waves travel down through the liquid. These waves bounces off the bottom of the bottle, /head back/ up to the top and then bounce back down again. The changing pressure in the bear rapidly expands and contracts any small bubbles. At a certain point, these bubbles burst under the pressure, creating thousands of new tiny new bubbles. Here where the chain reaction starts. Each of the tiny bubbles has a lot of surface area for its volumn so it is easy for the carbon dioxide to dissolve in the beer to get into the bubble and the bubbles get bigger and lighter as they go which makes them rise towards the top. As they rise, they pass through the new /parts/ of the liquid with lots of /spare/ carbon dioxide. A feedback loop starts, the bigger the bubbles get, the faster they rise and more CO2 absorbed which makes them even get bigger. The processes not unlike a mushroom cloud of a nuclear bomb, the violent result of uncontrolled chain reaction.And depending on one's mood, only slightly less tragic.

Humans can experience 10 million colors. It is rather amazing but not to a mantis shrimp. Beautiful, isn't it? This is a mentis shrimp. Mentis shrimp has 16 color receptors in their eyes, the most of any animals on our planet now what does this mean? Think about the world you live in, you're experiencing all this with 3 optical receptors. Because Mshrimp has so many more than us. Their light detecting ability is astronomically better and this can help them spot prey quicker making it an extrodinary hunter. It is only about 4 inches long but can stike a force at 335 pounds. It takes 9 pounds to breaks a nose and 25 to break a small bone and 400 to break through a block of cement. The movement of a M shrimp claw is one of the world's fastest for any animal on earth. They have even been known to break through aquarium of tanks. Remarkable.

Revolving doors, always open, always closed. So why do we have them?
Meet Theophilus Van Kannel//, a curmudgeon and a scrooge of sorts. Humbug! He hated lots of things, none more than chivalry, especially opening doors for women. He also hated, and I mean hated the awkward dance with all experienced. After you, no no no, after you. Van Kannel/ created a way to eliminate socialphobia. By drawing inspiration from a preexisting German translation door without draft of air. in 1888, Ben receive the patent for a storm door structure, aka the revolving door. in 1899, the first was install at Rectors, a restaurant in nYC. It was revolutionary. Not only did it eliminate forced social interaction, revolving door kept dust, rain, sleet, snow and noise from entering // buildings and kept the heat and the air conditioning inside. Seems great, energy efficient but there is a catch, no one uses them. In 2006, a MIT study founded only 20to 30 % of people were using the revolving doors. So why don't we use them? Probably swing doors are just easier but /Mr. Van Kannel / we salute you, the antisocial ways

It is plastic, it is most likely beige. And it sounds like this. Chances are if you grew up in the US, you /have played/ a recorder and it was a non-negotiable part of your elementry school education. And for that you can thank this guy, Carl Orff, a passionate German composer. Originally, the recorder was handcrafted, wooden, and made for the highest of society. Even Vivaldi and Bach wrote pieces for the recorder. It doesn't rely a reed or strings, just breath. It's in the flute family and in 1970s recorders started being to produce plastic, cheap plastic. So how did it become the clumsy, awkward sound  we all used to play?That's where Orf comes in. He saw the recorder as a easy way for the kids to just playing music. The logic was simple, the recorder relyed on rythms rather than memorization. If you can sing, you most likely can play it. Orff had the best of intentions to inspire the next generation to musicians and even know they can sometimes be annoying, our hats off to you, for changing the music course in education for generations to come.

Here is a riddle. Male honeybees don't have fathers, but they do have grandfathers. They also can't have sons but they can have grandsons. How is this possible? Bees have weird family trees because of something called Haplodiploidy. Ploidy refers to the copies of Chromosomes an organisms has. Humans are diploid. We have one set of 23 chromosome from our mothers and one set from our fathers. Honey bee queen and female workers are also deploied with 2 sets of 16 chromosomes but the male drones are haploid and have just one set inherit from their mother. A queen, when she lies an unfertilized egg. This difference makes for interesting family tree. Let's say that the black bars is a drone of chromosomes when he mates with a queen with the yellow chromosomes his daughters will get black chromosomes. Their brothers however are not. These daughter queens were eventually made and made their own eggs. Their sons make end up with their yellow chromosomes or they make up of their grandfather's black chromosomes. So take a moment to appreciate the weird bee family tree. Just not on father's day.

Researcher crawled deep in this Indianna cave to investigate ancient earthquakes, they thought the secret maybe locked inside the Stalagmites. For Scientific American, this is Dyani Sabin /. Just like tree /rings/, stalagmites holds clues about past climates and events. Stalagmites forms when water collects on cave ceiling and drips down to the floor. Sediments in the water build up into layers. Overtime, Stalagmite grows. Earthquakes can change where the drops land and how fast the water flows. THis shapes stalagmites growth. A shift in the stalagmite central axis tell scientists that there was an earthquake. If they date the layer where there the shift happened, researchers can tease out when these ancient earthquakes occurred just like the width of the tree ring reveal how much water the tree /got/ each year. Researcher can examine stalagmite layers to see how the climate has changed. By cracking open the stalagmite, scientists could see thousands of years of a cave's history.

They dance,they frail, they are big wacky and awkard way to get your attention. But did you know the tall boy debuted in 1996 Olympics as art?
Meet Peter Minshall, a prominant Carribean artist, known in Trinidad as the // creater of the larger than life dancing puppets created for carnival. His work /made its way to / a book called Carribean festival Arts. And that book made its way to a man, a man on the /steering/ committee of // Olympics. Peter was commissioned to help create unforgetable opening for the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. In the moment of nothing short of pure genius, Peter /returned to/ his roots by sketching a puppet-like structure but this time he turned it into a inflatable airman that can move and dance just like his manned puppets. For this he had to call another artist, Doron Gazit, an engineering who happened to be obsessed in anthing inflatable. Between both man, they were able to acomplish the seemingly impossible. 60 foot inflatable 2 legged dancing man. The tall boys were nothing short of success. After the Olympics, Gazy got a pattern and licensed designed for the design for advertisers. Now they are everywhere, used cat lots, cropped fields, shopping center, you name it. So the next time you see a big ridiculus inflated tall boy waving at you in the distance, just imagine you are in the Carribean, dancing along to the drum beat.

In the 1920s and up through the 1950s, Hollywood had a particular way of talking. Come around about noon tomorrow. What are you doing up there? Impersonating a book cover? Really? Really! It was called the midlantic or transatlantic accent but we don't speak like that anymore. So what happened?
To know why it has disappeared we need to know a little of history. The accent is sort of British American hybrid. Linguistic speaking, it has three tenets. One, drop the arc like the mathah or fathah, two emphasize the teeth like writer, winter and three soften your vowels like dangce of cahh and this accent was aquired so there is no line tracing back to history. Sampling came in early video when base tones were difficult to hear, but many attributed to the popularity of writer of edith skinner. // got a book called Speak with Distinction which was a deep book to help you learn the accent. Either way it was a language for the American upper class. People like FDR, Katharine Hapberg, Cary Grant, they all used it. But after WWII, the accent dwindled in popularity. With the growing of middle class, an aristocratic accent was no longer fashionable. As for Hollywood, acting methods changed and the accent was just too fake. So it disappeared mostly. If you have ever seen the Show Frasier, Niles and Frasier spoked in an updated mid-atlantic accent. To let the women I love die before your eyes. That's right, I said I loved her.

 You probabaly know that pi is 3.1415 something followed by many many more digits. But what is pi and how do you estimate its value? This is Scientific American, I am Lydia Chain.
 Pi, relates the circle's circumference to its diameter, it is simply a ratio. Roll a circle on the ruler measures its circumference and divided by the circle's diameter, you get pi, every time. Of course your measurement is only as accurate as your ruler. Mathmetians have /stuggled/for thousands of years to /pin down/ pi's exact value. But pi is an irrational number, which means that there are infinitely many digits after the digit point with no apparent patterns. So the chanllenge is to determine as many digits as possible. Archimedes solved for pi by drawing polygons arounds the circle. You can multiple the polygons number of sides by the length of each sides to find its circumference. The more sides the polygon has, the closer it is to the actural circumference of the circle and the closer you are the true pi value. Modern researcher has created a variety of increasingly complex methods to crunch the numbers. And super computers can now calculate the pi to trillions of digits. If you want a bigger slice of pi or calculate a bigger slice check out these articles on Scientific American.

Submarine is a bit chilly today team, hats on. It is good to have a support system at sea. My grandfather Jocques Cousteau knew how valuable friends were. Beautiful specimen, aren't they. I've got a pistol shrimp and a Goby fish in the bag. But these two are mutualistic symbiotic relationship which means they depend on each other for survival. Here is our works. The piston shrimp is amazing digger but nearly blind. The goby fish likes living in the ocean floor tunnels but cannot dig. The gobby has great eyesight, the shrimp has a great digging claw. They are a perfect match. These two pair up and it's the shrimp digs the goby keeps watch for predators. Once they pair, they are inseperable. That ia a deal, the gobby gets a home and the shrimp gets a seeing eyefish. Scientists are sure how these two find each other in the first place. It could be a chamical or optical attraction. Either way, it's a beautiful thing.

It's red and pricey, it's a critter and delicacy. It's the creme de la creme // of seafood. But this beloved summertime favorite was once thought of as the poor man's food. Say what?
It is said that in the early 16th century as the first /Pilgrims/ began to settle in bay areas of America that the ocean overflows with the lobsters. No, literally, they are overflowed. Imaging a shore of lobsters wall, 2 feet tall. As one would expect, the settler ate them up all until anything eaten three times a day they got sick of them, eventually /deeming/ them the cockroaches// of the sea. After that lobsters were used for fertilizer, fish bait and ultimately prinson food. They were fed so often to inmates. There was even a law enact // to protect sad inmates from cruel and unusual lobster punishment. So how did the lobster become the succulent delicacy we all know and love. Fast forward to mid 1800, can food became a thing as did the railroad. Lots were canned and shipped to middle America. At the same time, middle American started travelling them to New England for fresh lobster. By the late 1880s, prices began to surge and by WWII lobsters became the pricy specialty we've all grown to enjoy.

If you are slipping around this winter, your boots might be to blame. Researchers built wintry pod to test how well different boots will handle an icy day. For Scientific American, I am Dyani Sabin. The scientists wanted to measure the grip of winter boots on ice to give them a traction rating. The slip test is simple: a volunteer just walks across a floor of ice wearing a pair of test boots. After each successful trip, the floor is tipped by a degree. A boot just has to make it pass a angle of handicap ramp //, a 7 degree slope to pass. They tested of 98 boots, 90 of them failed. Even if you are not climbing slopes, this slippage score matters because it correlates with the maneuverability on flat ground. If you are stuck in bad boot this season, you can reduce slipping by walking slowly and avoiding over striding or foot rotation. New boot technology features antislip measures like aluminum oxide grit or furry glass fibers embedded in the sole. Prototypes of these boots have already surpassed the researchers slip scale. The next winter, you might not have to channel your inner ice dancer to survive sidewalks.

 It's Thanksgiving. Turkeys, /stuffing/ mashed potatoes but the one thing that has always stood out is a bit of a head scratcher, sweet potato casserole.
 We're pretty sure that sweet potatoes in marshmallows were not at the original thanksgivings, so what happened？ Sweet potatoes have been around forever and marshmallows this sticky gooey mess actually comes from a plant and has been around since ancient Egypt, a delicacy only pharaohs could eat. Ok fast forward to the 20th century, marshmallow were a big deal and expensive and essentially the crystal of sweet treats. Not only that, but they were even hand made. Marshmelows became a mainstay for highfalutin housewives. Back then house wifes would have to make whipped cream or even meringue by hand but marshmellow were the modern time saver. The first recipe that paired sweet potatoes marshmellows appeared in 1918 and a trade journal cleverly name sweet potatoes and Yums. As marshnals grew in popularity and began being mass produced. More and More recipes began implementing them as an everyday ingredient. Nowadays marshnals are generally reserved for campfires and hot chocolate and that's non traditional traditional favorite. Whether you like sweet potatoes a la marshmallow or plain, happy Thanksgiving.

Jupter is /cloaded in an/ energy mistery. Its /upper/ atmosphere is about as hot as the earth's. Even though the giant planet is five times further from the sun. Where does the heat come from? Intense magnetic fields create beautiful atmosphere heating auroras on the planet but new infrared images show that heat is confined mostly to the north and south poles. But near the equator, there is another heat source. The air above the Jupter's great red spot, the solar system largest storm is hundreds of degrees warmer than its surroundings. This suggests that the heat comes from the stroms below. Pherhaps by slashing shockwaves from turbulent winds and solves the riddle of how Jupter's upper atmosphere stay so warm so far from the sun.

Country music and grabbing your partner for a Do--si-do? You probably have a fuzzy memory of trying to massive these moves in middle school gym class, am I right? So why were we all forced to couple up endure this embrassment? Well it all things to Henry Ford. Now grab a partner in Do-si-do.
He was the father of the car and the assembly line. But here is a little-known fact: Henry Ford loves to dance, expecially with his wife Clara. Square dancing has deep roots in American culture dating back to Colonial Times. It remain popular until the waltzs and /polka/ mainstream in the 19th century.

Broads of education across the country started endorsing Fords mission and since then students are taught to square dance. Today 24 states still // square dancing as their official state dance. So if you are /feel like reliving / akward dancing in gym class moments I am sure you can find some square dancing lessons somewhere nearby.

To play the music, that is utilizing our gentle earth, it's like you are becoming one with the instrument in a very true way. You just sit and go. Yes.
We are looking at the Gteat Stalacpipe organ of the Luray Caverns in Luray Virginia. When I sense a key, it sends an electrical pulse of a rubber tipped mallet which strike the stalactite, causing and producing a incredibly beautiful music tone. The area of the strike cover is roughly three and half acres which then makes literally the world's largest musical instrument. It is very gentle sound and very peaceful. There is only one like it in the world. It is something incredibly different and wonderfully beautiful.

Nylon stockings make me think of Melanie Griffith in working girl. But they actually have a intersting past and it involves the US army, the /gravy/ juice and the department store riots. Until the 1930s, women wore silk and nylon stockings because having your /legs/ uncovered was not acceptable but then WWII happened. The US military began buying nylon and silk and using them to make parachutes and tires and cords. So women donated their stockings to the war effort. The official model for women during WWII was make do and Mend. Wartime ads told the women that they need to keep up /appearances/. So when life gave them lemons women in the late 40th, they make liquid stockings. IT was a makeup for your legs, kind of like a self /tanner/. It looks like stockings if applied well. Women even drew the seamline on the back of their calves and this was not easy. Some /salons/ are offered as servers. But if /this foundation/ wasn't around, women used gravy juice. That brownish /hue/ mimicked the color of liquid stockings and it worked. Soon after the WWII, /Dupont/ the big name of /stocking/ manufacturing said they would be producing women's nylons again. In 1946, a store in Pittsburgh announced that they finally had them. Roughly 40,000 women showed up, only to find out 13,000 pairs were available. Fighting ensued and 1946 became to known as the year of the nylon riots. Obviously, /Dupont/ got their act together by the end of that year. Nylon depression ended and out went the gravy tights. /Thank goodness/.

Pogs, you probably remember this prolific 90s fad. But what you may not know is that pogs have roots that go all the way back to 17th century Japan. OK, first things first, let's review the rules. To play you start with a stack of pogs, all face down. Player one takes the slammer and throws it down onto the piles and keeps any and all pogs that land face up. Pogs remained face down are restacked and the game continues on. The player with the most pogs at the end of the game wins. Hooray! The origin of the pogs can be traced back to this: Menko, a classic Japanese game. Players throw cards to their opponent's cards with /the goal / of flipping them over. IN the early 1900s, Japanese immigrants settled in Hawaii and brought the game with them. Overtime it involved into a /version/ play with milk and juice cap from a local dairy company in Maui eventually renaming it pogs after their juice that was made out of a passion fruit orange and Guava. Get it? In 1991, this woman, /a six grade/ teacher named Blosson Galbiso introduced the game to her class. Her goals was to teach them math/, but in the fun way. And it worked big time. Kids loved it and the game exploded in popularity through Hawaii and then spread to the mainland. As the game took off, this marketing guy Alan Rypinski took /note/. He purchased the trade marker's pogs, founded the world pog federation and got them to every store in American. And subsequently into nearly every home with 90's kids. Thanks Alan!
