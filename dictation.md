The fertile/ plains alongside of the yellow river, cradled ancient Chinese civilization. But the floods of the yellow river has killed millions of people, earning the nickname of China's Sorrow. Small particles in the water called sediment can clog in the river forcing the water spill out onto land. It was one of the most sediment-laden river in the world. Previous /models /couldn't decount for how much sediment yellow river carries. A new model more accurately described sediment transport in the water // which could help scientists predict and prevent floods. Researchers used a 3D scanner to peer through the muddy river and map on the river's bottom and when they turn on the scanner, what they saw was so unexpected, they saw the equipment was broken the bottom of the yellow river was flat. The bottom of most river like Mississippi has underwater /dunes/ that rob energy from the water limiting how much forces available to push sediment downstream. On the flat riverbed more of the river's energy can sweep particles along. Additional tests  shown that yellow river has much finer sediments than other rivers . THe particles can staytes and suspended in the water rather than sinking. These factors let the river dump more than a billion tons of sediments into the sea each year. More than 600 million tons . are deposited. along the way. The team's new model explains how the yellow river can carry so much sediment they say it could also explain other types of sediment systems from erroding coast line to antartic /glaciers/ to the martianshing plains, and predicting when and where sediment buildup might causing flooding to help scientists to protect 80 million people living alongside the yellow river banks.

Are these golf balls, a science fiction set, an alien invasion? Nope, this is Bolwoningen. and the only inhabitants here are humans. Located in the Netherland and about an hour way from Armstadam, 50 sphere houses made of sement and reinforced with fiberglass. B are actually translated of bowl or bulb homes, which was built in 1984 by Dutch artist and sculptor Dries Krejikamp. It was created  and  supported by a subsidy from Dutch government for experimental housing projects. Inside the houses are three levels: bedrooms on the ground and bathrooms on the middle, living space on the top. Although these homes look out of this world, their attention was to bring its inhabitants closer to nature. The round windows allow views of the outside environment from almost any angle and the complex itself in positioned near scenic canal. The designer .passed away. in 2014 however his legacy lives on  as these homes are still lived today.

Open up your wallet, you expect to find ones, tens twenties and maybe a hundo. THe last thing that you'd ever expect is a Tom, also known as a 2 dollar bill. Here is why. In 1862, the federal Government has just print its first paper money, the first and the only denominations were the 1 dollar and 2 dollar bills and keep in mind that people were making about 15 dollars a month. To pay using a 2 dollar bill is the status of symbol on the wealthiest Americans could afford. And a lot of times, they used them for under the  table transactions like /political/ bribe and prostitutes and gambling. The Tom ultimately got a bad /rap/ and was deemed unnecessary. In 1966, government took a ten year /hiatus and stop printing those bad boys. But in 1976, the government gave them another try, this time classing them up a bit, issuing a special /bicentennial bill. A little too classy, some would argue. people began in hiding them away as collector's items , leading to less bill in circulation, which brings us in present day, though rare Toms are still being printed and there are over a billing in circulation. Most people keep them as /keepsakes, thouth there is a  subculture of 2 dollar ambassadors who were set keeping the Tom alive and using them every chance they get. So the next time you pay a cash, go ahead and use a Tom.
