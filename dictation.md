The fertile/ plains alongside of the yellow river, cradled ancient Chinese civilization. But the floods of the yellow river has killed millions of people, earning the nickname of China's Sorrow. Small particles in the water called sediment can clog in the river forcing the water spill out onto land. It was one of the most sediment-laden river in the world. Previous /models /couldn't decount for how much sediment yellow river carries. A new model more accurately described sediment transport in the water // which could help scientists predict and prevent floods. Researchers used a 3D scanner to peer through the muddy river and map on the river's bottom and when they turn on the scanner, what they saw was so unexpected, they saw the equipment was broken the bottom of the yellow river was flat. The bottom of most river like Mississippi has underwater /dunes/ that rob energy from the water limiting how much forces available to push sediment downstream. On the flat riverbed more of the river's energy can sweep particles along. Additional tests  shown that yellow river has much finer sediments than other rivers . THe particles can staytes and suspended in the water rather than sinking. These factors let the river dump more than a billion tons of sediments into the sea each year. More than 600 million tons . are deposited. along the way. The team's new model explains how the yellow river can carry so much sediment they say it could also explain other types of sediment systems from erroding coast line to antartic /glaciers/ to the martianshing plains, and predicting when and where sediment buildup might causing flooding to help scientists to protect 80 million people living alongside the yellow river banks.

B are actually translated of bowl or bulb homes, which was built in 1984 by Dutch artist and sculptor Dries Krejikamp. It was created  and  supported by a subsidy from Dutch government for experimental housing projects. Inside the houses are three levels: bedrooms on the ground and bathrooms on the middle, living space on the top. Although these homes look out of this world, their attention was to bring its inhabitants closer to nature. The round windows allow views of the outside environment from almost any angle and the complex itself in positioned near scenic canal. The designer .passed away. in 2014 however his legacy lives on  as these homes are still lived today.

Open up your wallet, you expect to find ones, tens twenties and maybe a hundo. THe last thing that you'd ever expect is a Tom, also known as a 2 dollar bill. Here is why. In 1862, the federal Government has just print its first paper money, the first and the only denominations were the 1 dollar and 2 dollar bills and keep in mind that people were making about 15 dollars a month. To pay using a 2 dollar bill is the status of symbol on the wealthiest Americans could afford. And a lot of times, they used them for under the  table transactions like /political/ bribe and prostitutes and gambling. The Tom ultimately got a bad /rap/ and was deemed unnecessary. In 1966, government took a ten year /hiatus and stop printing those bad boys. But in 1976, the government gave them another try, this time classing them up a bit, issuing a special /bicentennial bill. A little too classy, some would argue. people began in hiding them away as collector's items , leading to less bill in circulation, which brings us in present day, though rare Toms are still being printed and there are over a billing in circulation. Most people keep them as /keepsakes, thouth there is a  subculture of 2 dollar ambassadors who were set keeping the Tom alive and using them every chance they get. So the next time you pay a cash, go ahead and use a Tom.

If you are afraid of coming down and going and swimming in the ocean because of sharks you should be terrified to make a piece of toast. 400 people died last year from defective toasters where there are less than 10 did from sharks. This is the first large shark expedition like this in the western gulf. We will be tagging hammerheaded sharks, tiger sharks and Mako sharks, trying to understand how they /are leveraging/ the gulf and their /birthing,/ mating and full migratory patterns. We will be getting up everyday just before dawn, the fishing team will be going out getting all of our lines rigged and ready to go. And we will get the ship in position with lift in the water and we are gonna looking to capture, bring the shark back to the lift, lifting them out of the water, once we do that, a whole team of scientist from half dozen institutions will circle around the shark and we are going to conduct 12 reseach projects in about 15 minutes then release the shark to the open sourse the tracking to the world so that everyone can follow it. What we are finding is that these massive sharks have huge huge movements across the ocean and we have one of these sharks Lydia has travelled over 35 000 miles in just 2 years, very very regular for these sharks to be swimming thousands of miles a month, which is why so important to figure out where they go. We are losing 200,000 sharks a day for shark fin soup-- hundred million a year.And people need to understand, an ocean with no shark means the ocean with no fish. They are the lion and balance keeper of the ocean and if they are not the whole food chain collapses. THis is a simple battle, we've gotta solve the puzzles the sharks' lives to make sure they flourish and make a difference for the future.

At NY's American Museum of Natural History, we are past the Roosevelt Atrium, through the Frick building and tucked away behind the /drawers/ of bones. Dr. Jack Tsengis hard at worked. He is a dog guy. Well I have worked on dog revolution and dog/ fossil/ for about 10 years. Jackson is the man when it /comes/  dog revolution. He says dogs have a /shot at outliving/ living us all. 
Humans have been evolving for roughly three million years but dogs have been around way longer. And that history goes all the way back 40 million years. It hasn't been easy, they have dealt with warming, cooling and iceage. To determine how dogs /are goint to fare/ as the world changes, you have to start in the past because dogs are evolutionary marvels. The first dogs weren't really dogs as we know them today they were /tree-dwellers/ and really small. They changed to survive: their legs lengthen so that they can run longer distances and they grew a lot. During the ice age the big wolves weight around 140 pounds but it is their teeth that are really the key to their survival. Their teeth are getting stronger to deal with the larger bones and grit /that they make in your mouth/ when they are hunting. What he says is that it is biological that the dogs are eating machines. Think of their teeth as the basic blueprint as they goes back 40 million years and can be adapted to any kind of environmental change. THe teeth in the back crush bone. Those teeth in the middle are for cutting and the front teeth are for puncturing. What is more, dogs' teeth have reinforced surfaces, that means their teeth will stay intack whether they are eating larger bones or chewing /up/ carcasses. It also means dogs do not really need us. Dogs are able to survive even if we are no longer around to feed them because they can eat pretty much anything that comes their way. If we do go and they are left, I am sure that they will adapt whatever environment comes their way.

That is a terrible thing to do with a beer. All that delicious malty goodness gone to waste. But why should tap on top trigger a foam explosion while clink on the side  signals the start/ of a/ drink with friends? It has to do with shake with a beer bottle. When you bonk the beer bottle on top, the hit creates pressure waves travel down through the liquid. These waves bounces off the bottom of the bottle, /head back/ up to the top and then bounce back down again. The changing pressure in the bear rapidly expands and contracts any small bubbles. At a certain point, these bubbles burst under the pressure, creating thousands of new tiny new bubbles. Here where the chain reaction starts. Each of the tiny bubbles has a lot of surface area for its volumn so it is easy for the carbon dioxide to dissolve in the beer to get into the bubble and the bubbles get bigger and lighter as they go which makes them rise towards the top. As they rise, they pass through the new /parts/ of the liquid with lots of /spare/ carbon dioxide. A feedback loop starts, the bigger the bubbles get, the faster they rise and more CO2 absorbed which makes them even get bigger. The processes not unlike a mushroom cloud of a nuclear bomb, the violent result of uncontrolled chain reaction.And depending on one's mood, only slightly less tragic.

Humans can experience 10 million colors. It is rather amazing but not to a mantis shrimp. Beautiful, isn't it? This is a mentis shrimp. Mentis shrimp has 16 color receptors in their eyes, the most of any animals on our planet now what does this mean? Think about the world you live in, you're experiencing all this with 3 optical receptors. Because Mshrimp has so many more than us. Their light detecting ability is astronomically better and this can help them spot prey quicker making it an extrodinary hunter. It is only about 4 inches long but can stike a force at 335 pounds. It takes 9 pounds to breaks a nose and 25 to break a small bone and 400 to break through a block of cement. The movement of a M shrimp claw is one of the world's fastest for any animal on earth. They have even been known to break through aquarium of tanks. Remarkable.

Revolving doors, always open, always closed. So why do we have them?
Meet Theophilus Van Kannel//, a curmudgeon and a scrooge of sorts. Humbug! He hated lots of things, none more than chivalry, especially opening doors for women. He also hated, and I mean hated the awkward dance with all experienced. After you, no no no, after you. Van Kannel/ created a way to eliminate socialphobia. By drawing inspiration from a preexisting German translation door without draft of air. in 1888, Ben receive the patent for a storm door structure, aka the revolving door. in 1899, the first was install at Rectors, a restaurant in nYC. It was revolutionary. Not only did it eliminate forced social interaction, revolving door kept dust, rain, sleet, snow and noise from entering // buildings and kept the heat and the air conditioning inside. Seems great, energy efficient but there is a catch, no one uses them. In 2006, a MIT study founded only 20to 30 % of people were using the revolving doors. So why don't we use them? Probably swing doors are just easier but /Mr. Van Kannel / we salute you, the antisocial ways

It is plastic, it is most likely beige. And it sounds like this. Chances are if you grew up in the US, you /have played/ a recorder and it was a non-negotiable part of your elementry school education. And for that you can thank this guy, Carl Orff, a passionate German composer. Originally, the recorder was handcrafted, wooden, and made for the highest of society. Even Vivaldi and Bach wrote pieces for the recorder. It doesn't rely a reed or strings, just breath. It's in the flute family and in 1970s recorders started being to produce plastic, cheap plastic. So how did it become the clumsy, awkward sound  we all used to play?That's where Orf comes in. He saw the recorder as a easy way for the kids to just playing music. The logic was simple, the recorder relyed on rythms rather than memorization. If you can sing, you most likely can play it. Orff had the best of intentions to inspire the next generation to musicians and even know they can sometimes be annoying, our hats off to you, for changing the music course in education for generations to come.

Here is a riddle. Male honeybees don't have fathers, but they do have grandfathers. They also can't have sons but they can have grandsons. How is this possible? Bees have weird family trees because of something called Haplodiploidy. Ploidy refers to the copies of Chromosomes an organisms has. Humans are diploid. We have one set of 23 chromosome from our mothers and one set from our fathers. Honey bee queen and female workers are also deploied with 2 sets of 16 chromosomes but the male drones are haploid and have just one set inherit from their mother. A queen, when she lies an unfertilized egg. This difference makes for interesting family tree. Let's say that the black bars is a drone of chromosomes when he mates with a queen with the yellow chromosomes his daughters will get black chromosomes. Their brothers however are not. These daughter queens were eventually made and made their own eggs. Their sons make end up with their yellow chromosomes or they make up of their grandfather's black chromosomes. So take a moment to appreciate the weird bee family tree. Just not on father's day.

Researcher crawled deep in this Indianna cave to investigate ancient earthquakes, they thought the secret maybe locked inside the Stalagmites. For Scientific American, this is Dyani Sabin /. Just like tree /rings/, stalagmites holds clues about past climates and events. Stalagmites forms when water collects on cave ceiling and drips down to the floor. Sediments in the water build up into layers. Overtime, Stalagmite grows. Earthquakes can change where the drops land and how fast the water flows. THis shapes stalagmites growth. A shift in the stalagmite central axis tell scientists that there was an earthquake. If they date the layer where there the shift happened, researchers can tease out when these ancient earthquakes occurred just like the width of the tree ring reveal how much water the tree /got/ each year. Researcher can examine stalagmite layers to see how the climate has changed. By cracking open the stalagmite, scientists could see thousands of years of a cave's history.

They dance,they frail, they are big wacky and awkard way to get your attention. But did you know the tall boy debuted in 1996 Olympics as art?
Meet Peter Minshall, a prominant Carribean artist, known in Trinidad as the // creater of the larger than life dancing puppets created for carnival. His work /made its way to / a book called Carribean festival Arts. And that book made its way to a man, a man on the /steering/ committee of // Olympics. Peter was commissioned to help create unforgetable opening for the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. In the moment of nothing short of pure genius, Peter /returned to/ his roots by sketching a puppet-like structure but this time he turned it into a inflatable airman that can move and dance just like his manned puppets. For this he had to call another artist, Doron Gazit, an engineering who happened to be obsessed in anthing inflatable. Between both man, they were able to acomplish the seemingly impossible. 60 foot inflatable 2 legged dancing man. The tall boys were nothing short of success. After the Olympics, Gazy got a pattern and licensed designed for the design for advertisers. Now they are everywhere, used cat lots, cropped fields, shopping center, you name it. So the next time you see a big ridiculus inflated tall boy waving at you in the distance, just imagine you are in the Carribean, dancing along to the drum beat.

In the 1920s and up through the 1950s, Hollywood had a particular way of talking. Come around about noon tomorrow. What are you doing up there? Impersonating a book cover? Really? Really! It was called the midlantic or transatlantic accent but we don't speak like that anymore. So what happened?
To know why it has disappeared we need to know a little of history. The accent is sort of British American hybrid. Linguistic speaking, it has three tenets. One, drop the arc like the mathah or fathah, two emphasize the teeth like writer, winter and three soften your vowels like dangce of cahh and this accent was aquired so there is no line tracing back to history. Sampling came in early video when base tones were difficult to hear, but many attributed to the popularity of writer of edith skinner. // got a book called Speak with Distinction which was a deep book to help you learn the accent. Either way it was a language for the American upper class. People like FDR, Katharine Hapberg, Cary Grant, they all used it. But after WWII, the accent dwindled in popularity. With the growing of middle class, an aristocratic accent was no longer fashionable. As for Hollywood, acting methods changed and the accent was just too fake. So it disappeared mostly. If you have ever seen the Show Frasier, Niles and Frasier spoked in an updated mid-atlantic accent. To let the women I love die before your eyes. That's right, I said I loved her.

 You probabaly know that pi is 3.1415 something followed by many many more digits. But what is pi and how do you estimate its value? This is Scientific American, I am Lydia Chain.
 Pi, relates the circle's circumference to its diameter, it is simply a ratio. Roll a circle on the ruler measures its circumference and divided by the circle's diameter, you get pi, every time. Of course your measurement is only as accurate as your ruler. Mathmetians have /stuggled/for thousands of years to /pin down/ pi's exact value. But pi is an irrational number, which means that there are infinitely many digits after the digit point with no apparent patterns. So the chanllenge is to determine as many digits as possible. Archimedes solved for pi by drawing polygons arounds the circle. You can multiple the polygons number of sides by the length of each sides to find its circumference. The more sides the polygon has, the closer it is to the actural circumference of the circle and the closer you are the true pi value. Modern researcher has created a variety of increasingly complex methods to crunch the numbers. And super computers can now calculate the pi to trillions of digits. If you want a bigger slice of pi or calculate a bigger slice check out these articles on Scientific American.

Submarine is a bit chilly today team, hats on. It is good to have a support system at sea. My grandfather Jocques Cousteau knew how valuable friends were. Beautiful specimen, aren't they. I've got a pistol shrimp and a Goby fish in the bag. But these two are mutualistic symbiotic relationship which means they depend on each other for survival. Here is our works. The piston shrimp is amazing digger but nearly blind. The goby fish likes living in the ocean floor tunnels but cannot dig. The gobby has great eyesight, the shrimp has a great digging claw. They are a perfect match. These two pair up and it's the shrimp digs the goby keeps watch for predators. Once they pair, they are inseperable. That ia a deal, the gobby gets a home and the shrimp gets a seeing eyefish. Scientists are sure how these two find each other in the first place. It could be a chamical or optical attraction. Either way, it's a beautiful thing.

It's red and pricey, it's a critter and delicacy. It's the creme de la creme // of seafood. But this beloved summertime favorite was once thought of as the poor man's food. Say what?
It is said that in the early 16th century as the first /Pilgrims/ began to settle in bay areas of America that the ocean overflows with the lobsters. No, literally, they are overflowed. Imaging a shore of lobsters wall, 2 feet tall. As one would expect, the settler ate them up all until anything eaten three times a day they got sick of them, eventually /deeming/ them the cockroaches// of the sea. After that lobsters were used for fertilizer, fish bait and ultimately prinson food. They were fed so often to inmates. There was even a law enact // to protect sad inmates from cruel and unusual lobster punishment. So how did the lobster become the succulent delicacy we all know and love. Fast forward to mid 1800, can food became a thing as did the railroad. Lots were canned and shipped to middle America. At the same time, middle American started travelling them to New England for fresh lobster. By the late 1880s, prices began to surge and by WWII lobsters became the pricy specialty we've all grown to enjoy.

If you are slipping around this winter, your boots might be to blame. Researchers built wintry pod to test how well different boots will handle an icy day. For Scientific American, I am Dyani Sabin. The scientists wanted to measure the grip of winter boots on ice to give them a traction rating. The slip test is simple: a volunteer just walks across a floor of ice wearing a pair of test boots. After each successful trip, the floor is tipped by a degree. A boot just has to make it pass a angle of handicap ramp //, a 7 degree slope to pass. They tested of 98 boots, 90 of them failed. Even if you are not climbing slopes, this slippage score matters because it correlates with the maneuverability on flat ground. If you are stuck in bad boot this season, you can reduce slipping by walking slowly and avoiding over striding or foot rotation. New boot technology features antislip measures like aluminum oxide grit or furry glass fibers embedded in the sole. Prototypes of these boots have already surpassed the researchers slip scale. The next winter, you might not have to channel your inner ice dancer to survive sidewalks.

 It's Thanksgiving. Turkeys, /stuffing/ mashed potatoes but the one thing that has always stood out is a bit of a head scratcher, sweet potato casserole.
 We're pretty sure that sweet potatoes in marshmallows were not at the original thanksgivings, so what happened？ Sweet potatoes have been around forever and marshmallows this sticky gooey mess actually comes from a plant and has been around since ancient Egypt, a delicacy only pharaohs could eat. Ok fast forward to the 20th century, marshmallow were a big deal and expensive and essentially the crystal of sweet treats. Not only that, but they were even hand made. Marshmelows became a mainstay for highfalutin housewives. Back then house wifes would have to make whipped cream or even meringue by hand but marshmellow were the modern time saver. The first recipe that paired sweet potatoes marshmellows appeared in 1918 and a trade journal cleverly name sweet potatoes and Yums. As marshnals grew in popularity and began being mass produced. More and More recipes began implementing them as an everyday ingredient. Nowadays marshnals are generally reserved for campfires and hot chocolate and that's non traditional traditional favorite. Whether you like sweet potatoes a la marshmallow or plain, happy Thanksgiving.

Jupter is /cloaded in an/ energy mistery. Its /upper/ atmosphere is about as hot as the earth's. Even though the giant planet is five times further from the sun. Where does the heat come from? Intense magnetic fields create beautiful atmosphere heating auroras on the planet but new infrared images show that heat is confined mostly to the north and south poles. But near the equator, there is another heat source. The air above the Jupter's great red spot, the solar system largest storm is hundreds of degrees warmer than its surroundings. This suggests that the heat comes from the stroms below. Pherhaps by slashing shockwaves from turbulent winds and solves the riddle of how Jupter's upper atmosphere stay so warm so far from the sun.

Country music and grabbing your partner for a Do--si-do? You probably have a fuzzy memory of trying to massive these moves in middle school gym class, am I right? So why were we all forced to couple up endure this embrassment? Well it all things to Henry Ford. Now grab a partner in Do-si-do.
He was the father of the car and the assembly line. But here is a little-known fact: Henry Ford loves to dance, expecially with his wife Clara. Square dancing has deep roots in American culture dating back to Colonial Times. It remain popular until the waltzs and /polka/ mainstream in the 19th century. So in the 1920s, Ford took upon himself to revive the old tradition. He opened a ballroom in his hometown and encouraged his factory worker and their family to take part. He felt square dancing help teach manners, exercise, values and grace. Soon after he worked to create a national square dancing program. Broads of education across the country started endorsing Fords mission and since then students are taught to square dance. Today 24 states still // square dancing as their official state dance. So if you are /feel like reliving / akward dancing in gym class moments I am sure you can find some square dancing lessons somewhere nearby. All jump up and never come down, swing your pretty girl round and round.

To play the music, that is utilizing our gentle earth, it's like you are becoming one with the instrument in a very true way. You just sit and go. Yes.
We are looking at the Gteat Stalacpipe organ of the Luray Caverns in Luray Virginia. When I sense a key, it sends an electrical pulse of a rubber tipped mallet which strike the stalactite, causing and producing a incredibly beautiful music tone. The area of the strike cover is roughly three and half acres which then makes literally the world's largest musical instrument. It is very gentle sound and very peaceful. There is only one like it in the world. It is something incredibly different and wonderfully beautiful.

Nylon stockings make me think of Melanie Griffith in working girl. But they actually have a intersting past and it involves the US army, the /gravy/ juice and the department store riots. Until the 1930s, women wore silk and nylon stockings because having your /legs/ uncovered was not acceptable but then WWII happened. The US military began buying nylon and silk and using them to make parachutes and tires and cords. So women donated their stockings to the war effort. The official model for women during WWII was make do and Mend. Wartime ads told the women that they need to keep up /appearances/. So when life gave them lemons women in the late 40th, they make liquid stockings. IT was a makeup for your legs, kind of like a self /tanner/. It looks like stockings if applied well. Women even drew the seamline on the back of their calves and this was not easy. Some /salons/ are offered as servers. But if /this foundation/ wasn't around, women used gravy juice. That brownish /hue/ mimicked the color of liquid stockings and it worked. Soon after the WWII, /Dupont/ the big name of /stocking/ manufacturing said they would be producing women's nylons again. In 1946, a store in Pittsburgh announced that they finally had them. Roughly 40,000 women showed up, only to find out 13,000 pairs were available. Fighting ensued and 1946 became to known as the year of the nylon riots. Obviously, /Dupont/ got their act together by the end of that year. Nylon depression ended and out went the gravy tights. /Thank goodness/.

Supreme Court justice Anthothony Kennedy announce Wednesday he's retiring, giving PDT the chance to cement consertive control over the high court. The 81 year old Kenedey said he is stepping down after 30 years on the court. The republican-led house rejected a far ranging immigration bill despite its 11th hours endorsement by PDT. The 301 to 121vote have nearly half of the repulicans opposing the measure. PT says he will probably meet with Russian president Vladimir putin of the upcoming trip to Europe July and an advisor to Putin said earlier on Wednesday that Moscow and Washington had agreed on date and location for a summit but said details would not be released until Thursday. T said it will likely happening in /Helsinki/ Finland or Vienna in Austria. In Germany, the defending champion at the world cup has been eliminated. The champion has been knocked out in the group stage following a two nothing lost to South Korea. it was the first time Germany has been knocked out in the first round since 1938.

Pogs, you probably remember this prolific 90s fad. But what you may not know is that pogs have roots that go all the way back to 17th century Japan. OK, first things first, let's review the rules. To play you start with a stack of pogs, all face down. Player one takes the slammer and throws it down onto the piles and keeps any and all pogs that land face up. Pogs remained face down are restacked and the game continues on. The player with the most pogs at the end of the game wins. Hooray! The origin of the pogs can be traced back to this: Menko, a classic Japanese game. Players throw cards to their opponent's cards with /the goal / of flipping them over. IN the early 1900s, Japanese immigrants settled in Hawaii and brought the game with them. Overtime it involved into a /version/ play with milk and juice cap from a local dairy company in Maui eventually renaming it pogs after their juice that was made out of a passion fruit orange and Guava. Get it? In 1991, this woman, /a six grade/ teacher named Blosson Galbiso introduced the game to her class. Her goals was to teach them math/, but in the fun way. And it worked big time. Kids loved it and the game exploded in popularity through Hawaii and then spread to the mainland. As the game took off, this marketing guy Alan Rypinski took /note/. He purchased the trade marker's pogs, founded the world pog federation and got them to every store in American. And subsequently into nearly every home with 90's kids. Thanks Alan!

Mac cheese, fine wine, and ice cream. There is something surprising they have in common. And that's Tomas Jefferson. Tomas Jefferson, founding father, third president, and author of the Declaration of Independence. Pretty impressive resume, but what we should really recognize Jefferson for is being a massive foodie. While serving /as an ambassador of France in late 17th hundreds, he /developed a/ specific appreciation for all things European. /While touring Europe/, he took detailed notes about modern farming and agriculture techniques. Upon returing to the US, he began to cultivate his own organic vegetable garden, /berry patch/ and /vineyard/. He even had a /macaroni pasta/ machine shiftover and introduced ice cream to his kitchen. After he was elected as president, he brought his passion for food to the White House. He even served one of his favorites, Macaroni and cheese at the state dinner in 1802. Even though he didn't come up the dinner recipes himself, Jefferson helped serving them a popular them by serving them as decadent dinner parties. So next time you retreat your favorite guilty pleasure, say a small thanks to Tomas Jefferson. Mr president, our taste /buds/ salute you.

Honey bees use bristle brush like legs to comb pollen from their eye hairs. When a bee visits a flower, it also picks up as much nutrien-rich pollen as it can carry. A honey bee is covered it fine hairs to maxmize polon collection even its eyes have a covering polen trapping hairs. Before the bee packs its polon into its saddlebags to carry back to the hive, it needs to remove the sticky powder blocking its vision. Researchers investigated how a honey bee gets itself cleaned up. The eye hair are spaced just tightly enough to balance pollen at the tip for easy removal. Leg hairs are coarser and denser than eye hairs. A swipe of brush like legs traps the pollen and clear these visions but only if the particles are at the right size. Too small like cornstarch and the particle stick among the eye hairs. The study suggests that honey bee hair is optimized for easy cleaning, it collects plenty of pollen but is /hassle/ free for the busy bee. For scientific American, I am Lydia Chain.

This is Wicket, a red panda. Tens years old, W is a fully grown male with the height of just 2 feet. Or slightly larger than your average house cat. As cute as he is, his population is decreasing dramatically with less than 10,000 left in the wild. Red panda in name, it is not closely related to the name of giant panda but actually close to the raccoon family. He loves to eat bamboo but won't turn down the occassional bird, insect and  mammal for a snack. Native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. Red panda live in trees and /are nimble/ agile climers. Their reddish-brown and bushy tales camouflage them in the habitats from predators like snow lepards. Besides other animals human pose a major threat, poaching and hunting them for their fur. The forest they live are shrinking fast and estimates say their population has been cut in half in the last 20 years. this is the red panda.

Beer bottles are typically just 3 colors. But does the color matter? A bottle's color determines just how much light get through to the beer inside. LIght might not seem like a big deal but it can cause chamical reactions in beer that affect the taste. Brewers call these beers lightstruck. Molecules from hops known as iso Alpha-acid are /what make/  beer bitter but they also make beer vulnerable to light. Visible light breaks part these Iso Alpha Acid with the help of Riboflavin also known as the vitamin B2 from /barley malt/. One of the resulting molecules known as the Oxyl Radical loses oxigen and carbon atoms and becomes a Carbonyl Racical. That molecule is eager for a new partner to bond with. And it finds /one in sulfhydryl / molecules that form when /visible /light/ breaks apart/ amino acids found in Barley malt. When they pair up they form a new compound called 3 methyl but 2 ene 1 thiol which is a bit of a mouthful so it often refered to as 3 MBT. 3 MBT happens to the very similar in structure in the chamical makeup to the compound responsible for /a skunk's/ to distinctive odor. And we can taste it up as just a few parts per billion. Some brewers use specially treated hop extracts so Iso Alpha acids won't break apart and form 3MBT. But even these beers may not be safe from funky flavors. /Light can still/ cause reaction that forms the molecule called 2 sulphanyl 3 methybutanol which taste like a onion. Different bottle colors block different amounts of light. Unsurprisingly clear bottles offer no protection from light and green bottles aren't much better but some brewers are still using them and customers have come to expect /skunky/ beer that might requires a slice of /citrus/. Amber bottles are most common for a reason. They block the most of the light almost completely stopping skunking. But if you wanted to avoid these pungent molecules your best /bet/ is just to stick to /sipping/ beers from cans.

I see a future ware, the classical race /car/ driver might feel like an outdated model. The robo car is fully electrical and autonomous race car that can someday race at formula 1 speeds. From /real time/ computing to artifitial intelligence to computer vision the robot car combines some the most advanced technologies in IT. Technology its creators hope will eventually land in your garage. We have a radar area in/ front/ , ultrasonics, five lighters that cover 360 degrees around the car, to GPS antennas // and we use all /four/ wings of the wheel to create /down/ force. We have very low drag and very high /down/ force. We could techniqally drive on the ceiling if somebody builds a track for us. The car's software is also critical to building the fastest car. /Algorithm/ use the date collected from various sensors to make the most efficient /lab/ possible. In reading it to be superficially in the code you make that goes each miliseconds means like meters. The team hopes the eracing like this is the precursor to a new sport featuring serveral mobile cars race against each other at /breakneck/ speeds. This should be driverless competition where we can see who is the best air driver in the world. The team hopes to attract top talents in the fields of engineering, design and computer science to optimize the car's software and hardware for the racetrack. Motor sports make sport punishing test to drive these vihecles. And /robot race team / believes that their work will hasten the process of bringing the autonomous electrical car home to consumers. 90percent of accidents /the course of / human factor all the /algorithms/ which will be created here for /collision/  avoidance or to be fastest driver will go directly to the normal road cars. We need to help people to adopt ideas that robots will be on the roads. Today probably it is difficult to accept but we believe when we'll show how robots are good in strict conditions it's easy to accept them on the road.

In the forest of Southeast Asia, high in the tree top, a mythical creature lives. It turns out that dragons are real. So I have to call a biologist. I am Anthony Russell from department of biological science of university of Calgary in Albert Canada. We are talking about a specis of flying lizard. So it is called Draco Volans which means flying dragons. OK these flying dragons are a little different from what we have seen in the movies. First starters, they are small, only about 8 inches long. And they don't breath fire but they do fly in a way. They are gliders which means they have a control of their desend and trajectory but they don't have any power in it. For every one foot they go down in vertical distance they are able to travel along 6 feet long. And that's because they don't actually have wings. They are actually modifications of their rips there is nothing to do with the legs and arms. Evolutionary speaking, this help lizard survive. They can escape attacks and they have broader living zone. So they might not be dragon dragons. But sometimes people name things because it is more dramatic effect. Well they're still incredible lizards actually no you know what? I am still gonna call them dragons.

How was the declaration of independence from the elements, millions of visitors and most of all, time. The national archives and record administration // uses physics, chemistry and technology to keep one of our nation's most important historic document safe. A special encasement designed by the national institute of standards and technology uses aluminum and titanium. /to isolate declaration of indenpendence from the outside environment. The frame of the base is machined from solid blocks of metal to minimize the risk of leaks and a seal made of tin and nicle alloy keeps air out. A double layer of tempered glass /with/ an anti-reflective coating is suspended over the document. It's not  bullet proof, sorry /Nic Cage/. But it is strong enough to withstand changes of temperature and barometric pressure. The document sits on a cellulose sheet of paper which helps regulate humidity. And an aluminum platform precisely cut to fit the parchments irregular edges so it is invisible to visitors. Parchment, which is made from animal skin is sensitive to air pollution and changes in humidity. So the air inside the case is inert argon gas at a relative humidity forty percent. Argon won't react with the parchment. And its atoms are too large to escape the glass, unlike helium which was used in older case. If the humidity is too low, the parchment can crack or ink can flake off. But if it's too humid, collagen of animal skin can turn to gelatin. To monitor the /conditions/ inside the case, archives used tools called absorbtion spectrometer. A beam of light trans into the case at small /sapphire/ window. It is reflected by a series of reflected mirrors under the platform to a sensor behind another sapphire window. This system can detect changes in humidity or the gas composition. Modifications can be made .to run. other test. The case is so airtight that NIST estimates that will be 100 years or more before the oxygen consentration the case reaches half a percent. The originals of American's life liberty, and pursue of happiness will be secured for many more independence days.

I was the first women to graduate with a Docorate from Julliard and now I play the toy piano . Life works in mysterious ways. I have transform the /toy/ piano into a real instrument. To play the piano well, you have to practice on it every bit as hard as you would on a normal piano. In fact I think you have to work even harder because the action is so primitive you can make it sound beautiful, you can make the sound convincing. It is a bit like going down a rabbit hole and taking your audience with you, way back down this avenue to your childhood days. Once a skeptical person came to a toy piano concert that I give, I am able to turn them around. It's a whole extended family now of people into toy pianos. It is a fearless little band we are willing to stick their necks out for for toys.

The trick is trying to think like a cat. It's one thing to think what would it be like if I were a cat. It is another thing to try to figure out is what is it like for a cat to be a cat. So I have different ways of creating purr kind of sounds. I am David Teie, a classical musician mostly by /trade/ play the cello in the National Symphony and I came up with the idea of writing music for cats. Here are my birds sound for study like slow them down. Cats are not /very vocal/ and not partically social. The ultimate goal is to be able to communicate in something like their language. What other the sounds are there that you know cats would enjoy. Most of the brain /development/ of cats happens outside the womb. I thought the sound of suckling is a reward related sound that all cats will have heard as the brains were forming, this /swishing/ kind of sound. Yeah I would totally use that and name that after your jacket, that's my Louis W swish. Another example of sound is /the purring/. When you play the music /how does/ a cat reacts exactly. There are things like they will rub up against the speakers of shows kind of, ownership but showing just attention and it tends to be more conforting of those cats who have had a something of a hard life. Cats who need more comfort are more comforted by it. Do you have a cat? No I actually don't. I am allergic to cats. You are allergic to cats. Yes.

We are standing on the backdeck of /Woods Hole's/ the newest research ship, the R/v Neil Armstrong and what we have behind us is the Neried  under ice. It is one of the newest robotic vihecles that's being designed specifically for studying ice /covered oceans here on earth/. /We have got photographs of hydro thermal vents/ we haven't been able to go down and study them in detail and this is the only kind of technology that could do that. The way we have /been able to/ study the /unperturbed system in the past is/ using the ice breakers where by breaking the holes in the ice. There is danger you are perturbing by system just by getting there in the first place. So what we have designed is a vehicle that you can launch for a breaker but it can then swim laterally under the ice to get to the unperturbed systems and study in new ways. The first seem on the back is the little black pods with orange propellers on them. So those are the /thrusters/ that's what we actually used / to control how the vehicles moves left and right and forwards and back. We have the high definition camera, so that;s we do out video sensing. And what we also have in there science /pay/load of things measured for example, basic physical parameters in the ocean, how salty it is, its temperature as you find hydro themal event on the sea floor in every different ocean. you don't find the same animals inhabiting that are thing niche.  There are different animals that have evolved to adapt to the same environment conditions. If we could understand where the barriers are between the different populations where these geographic provinces are, that could actually teach us something not only just about how hydrothermal vents were but also how evolution biology works in the //. So like a foundamental questions of how biological evolution exists.

There's something quite primal about being in a tree, something that just feels really /safe/. It is just great /go/ climb a tree. I am an arborist, it is someone who takes care of the tree. We prune, maintain, remove if dangerous /really/ the whole healthcare of the tree. In Melbourne we are quite lucky in the ranges. There's trees up there are 85 to 90 meters, really really big trees. At the moment I am at 24 meters at the tree in a beautiful red/ gum/. This tree we're today maybe 250 years old it will be such a /shame/ to the landscape to lose something like this. Is it dangerous? Yes probably it must be really dangerous. it is one of the most dangerous jobs in the world apparenly. Every single tree has something different to put into it. That hole is big enough to take one of the syringes and actually prevent all /leaf-miners / from attacking these leaves. Working with trees, understanding trees and having respect with trees is the only way I think you can then cut the trees. The thing is something the trees needs to come down. It is a obvious failure of // or the best one to come out, remove it safely and /advise about/ how they can replant.

My goal is to get every every single woman to carry around condoms,  just as they carry around everything else. It's like /a no brainer and it's like /joke like/ how do we get people to take selfies // with condom. I am Meika Hollender and I am a co founder of sustain which is a all natural sexual wellness / products marketed to// women. It you ask a man what he think of a woman who's carrying condoms, it is negative, 90+ percent of the time. Only 19 percent of single sexually active women use condoms regularly one in four college freshmen actually get a std during her first year at school. This is a crisis and this is the subject that isn' being talked about because when you think about condoms lubricant, these are products that can be seen as the taboo. Women are extremely unfortable buying and carrying a condom. When I go to my peers that my people that I know there are the worst offenders. We are trying to rebrand a little bit. and completely enpower women to take control of the sextual health with much better products. Most luberacant out there contain parabens and glycerin and petroleum, silicone. Our products having none of these things. There are aloe and water based. It is the only /faretrade/ certified /carcinogen/ free condom on the marketing of US. We are stating a conversation that needs to be had. /So I had a lot of timen taking to consumers about why they not only needs to be using our product but also why they should be just using condoms in general. You shold never feel ashamed for wanting or having sex. But the reality is, you're out there for you and you need to protect yourself nobody else is going to.

We are driving out to Long Island today, because we found out there is a man out there who legally change his name to Santa Clause. So yeah, we are gonna go interview Santa. It turns out this Santa is not so traditional. Ｉdrive a black Dodge pickup truck. With /vanity plates/. Oh yes I have /vanity plates/ it calls santasla. Before he was Santa, he was Frank. I was born in Broklyn but we lived there on Long island. I have been married for 23 years now. How do you tell your wife that you are changing your name to Santa Claus? She said as long as I don't have to change my name.Go right ahead. Santa has been Santa for almost 2 decades. And he is good at it. I probably on and this is not an exaggeration. Thousands of refrigerators. He got the laugh. You know that's my Santa laugh. The suit, I design my suit. But here is something about Santa that might surprise you. I have three tatoos on me of me. I am very /into zombies/ I love barbecue. I have a smoker and you can fit 150 meat in. He has got the Tiki hut and the above ground saltwater pool in his backyard. Yes I am that extreme when it comes to my idea of relaxation. So there is a little Frank left there. But no question, he is fully committed to being Santa. I want to look like the poem says. I am the most loved person on the planet. We totally met Santa.

It is the only straight tusk in the world. Typically, these are only found on males. It accually full of up to 10 million nerve endings helping the n detect the pressure, salt level and even temperature in the water. Here is an interesting fact. A n tusk is flexible. It can bend about one foot in any direction without breaking. It was originally thought these tusks were for dueling but new theory suggests that they are for attracting a mate. N don't migrate like other whale species. They spend their entire lives in ice Arctic Water hunting /squid/ fish and crab. If you want to see one live, you have to come up for north because n don't thrive capitivity. Rather, they die. Some animals, we human just can't tame.

Air pollution is easy to spot, hanging over the city or sputtering from a tale/pipe/. But there is a lot of indoor air pollution too, even it is not obvious. This scientific American 60s science. It is caused by volatile organic compound or VOCs. They can come from building materials like panes, carpets, homes and personal care products like cleaning chemical air freshner etc. Vadoud Niri, an Analytical Chemist at the state university of NY Oswego //. And they can also come from cosmetics, and that /cosmetics/  part is what caught Niri's attention. One day when I went to /nail salon/ with my wife, I noticed this smell of specifically acetone in there. Acetone can irritate your eyes, skin, nose and throat and at high concrentration can cause Nausea, headaches and other nervous systems problems. Niri figured one way to get rid of acetone might be house plants. He then ran his own experiment, using a air tight chamber, 8 vocs in concentration of similar those found in /nail salons/ and five house common plants. A jade plant, a spider plant, a Bromeliad, a Caribbean tree cactus and what is known as Dracaena plant. It turns out a 12 hour test, it was the Bromeliad that /scrubbed/ the most chemicals from the air. But as for the original quest moving acetone from /nail salons the Dracaena beat all the others, sucking up to 94 percent of the offensive compound. He presented the result of the American chemical society in Philadelphia. For house apartment he says: use a variety of plans to make sure you take all aocs from your indoor air. Plus they are an energy alternative to other air cleaning devices, in other words, a truely green solution.

In two German cities, like the birthplace of the world wide arts revolution. One which looked to strip buildings from necessary adornments and build the foundation of what it's called modern architecture. Welcome to the home of Bauhaus.
It all started here, Weimar University 1919. This is where German architect /Walter Gropius/ alongside other artists founded the Bauhaus movement. His office alludes what the architectural style would become. A force for clean simple designs fit for the everyday life. Not too far away in Weimar, is the first official Bauhaus building, Haus am Horn built for exhibition for 1923. Its  clean lines and lack of adornment might look average today but almost one hundred years ago, it was truly revolutionary. 17 miles away in Dessau, the movement continues in 1925 initiating its most fruitful period. The most stuning representation is the Bauhaus Dessau. Seen as the pivitol building in Bauhaus, this structure amaze the world with its steel frame constuction and asymmetrical plan. Nearby, you also have other buildings in the Bauhaus style, the industrialist, the minimalist, a static is visible in all of them. In 1932, the Bauhaus school moved to Berlin where it /dissolved/ itself a year later due to the nazi regime. Nevertheless the movement spreads all around the world, creating a international trend for all other sphere of arts

If I was put on a /desert island me/ and cube and given unlimited time, would I eventually figure out how to solve it or do you need to how to solve it, you need to be taught? It sort of depends on how you go about it, which a lot people think you know if I just keep twisting its bound to  fall back into place that's impossible because the Rubik's cube is just too complicated. If you were /to guess/, just based on how it looks, how many permutations will you think that this holds. Yeah, I don't know, billion? Every single /rubic/ tube has 43 /quintillion/ permutations and /a quintillion is a  billion of billion, so it's billion square it's ten to the power of 18, which a number of people can't even comprehend. If you gonna stack every single possible release cube permutation from end to end, it would extend seveal hundred of light years into space. But on the other hand if you focus on trying to develop a strategy, you certainly can succeed. For instance the man who created it, Erno Rubik,  he didn't' have a choice he didn't know if he could solve it. So you have talked in the book about some the latest math, we are still kind of learning /intricacies of Rubik's'/ cubes, and when it comes to how efficiently you can solve thing google made a recent break through right? Yes within the last of couple of years, a problem was finally solved that have been stumping for a very long time which is called the god's number problem. So every rubic cube in theory for every permutation has an optimal solution right? And for a long time it's been a open question what is the size of the optimal position in terms of times of the modes, how efficient is it possible to be? Only after you use some super computer Google who specifications man under reps with determine that 20 is god's number. In other words, if there were /omniscient/ being given a Rubik's' cube, that omniscient being would be solve in 20 moves or fewer every single time. There is a / separate/ competition called the fewest move competition which is mostly mathmatical minded of the Rubik's cube 17 different events we do. In an hour, and you try to come up with the most efficient solutions possible. So if I am doing that, I could  spend a lot of time looking at this and deciding trying out if there a more efficient means of doing this, you know , the you know the algorithms I know which does that.

Hair trends as quickly as they appear, they disappear except for this one. Mans powdered wigs a trend that strangely lasted a century and has closed ties not to  fashion but to an STD. Powdered wigs also known as the perukes were all the rage in the 1700s. They were the hot item for aristocratic men but it wasn't a stylistic choice. Rather men mostly wore the wigs because of the /syphilis/. Started in 1580, /syphilis/ outbreaks spread to become one of the worst epidemics to ever hit Europe, on par with the black death. There were no antibiotics to combat the disease and so victims faced the blindness dementia, hair loss and even open sores. At that time going bald is considered as quite embarassing. As /syphilis/ spread the wig makers got busy. They created beautiful perukes /coated/ with powder and even scented with lavender to hide any unpleasant smells. At this point, the wigs are not yet considered as stylish but all that changes in 1655 when Luis 14th started going bald. Clearly the king of friends couldn't be seen without hair so he did what any man of that day they would. He bought a wig well actually he hided 48 of the best wig makers to create him a custom wig. 5 years later, the king of the England did the same thing. Shortly thereafter, aristicrats followed the /suit/ and does term bigwig was born.

But when it came to packaging their discovery they tested 5 hundreds different types of nozzles. Through their test, Fish /came/ upon one that produce a string, a string that shot 30 feet across the room. Inspired, they decided to turn their /instant cast/ into a toy. After alternative formula to produce more colorful less sticky string, the pair set out to market their product.Either of them knew the first thing of selling toys so they made an appointment with Wham-o in CA. But the mean didn't go exactly as planned. Fish and Cox sprayed the string all over the office including on the person they are meeting with. And unsurprisingly, they were asked to leave the premises. Just one day later, Fish recieved a telegram from Wham-o asking them to seng 24 cans for a market test. Turns out the trace of the silly string was left on the lamp shade in the office and was later spot by W 's owners who themselves demanded a market test immediately. 2 weeks later, W signed up a contract to license the product now known as  silly string.

If you are like, you know that multitasking does not always save time. You slow sown or make mistakes that require fixing. But maybe I am doing the wrong things. A new study shows that people on a stationary bike pedald faster when they simultaneously tackled by some sort of mental test. Even the researcher were surprised by that result. They originally set out to demonstrate what other studies have shown that 2 people tried to do two things at once, they do both more poorly. Their counterintuitive finding is in the /journal Plos One. In the experiment, subjects were asked to complete various cognitive of jobs that ranged in difficulty. Everything /from saying/ go when they saw a blue star and a projection screen, to remembering a long list of numbers and then repeating them back in reverse order. They tackled these tests once while sitting in a quiet room while on a bike. Turns out cyclists rode 25 percent faster when they were distracted by some mental gymnastics but only when the tests were relatively easy. When confronted with tougher /brainteasers, their cycling speeds were about the same as when they have nothing in particular to think about. And the case for wondering, the participation of cycling neither help nor hinder their brain function. The findings's good point toward a new program in which you get better workout simply by using our heads.

Since 1990, overfishing in juveniles has affected the populations bucause not enough fish reach maturity to change sex. Regulations were put in place but not enough with done to slow the overfishing with the specis. The snowy grouper is now listed as the vulnerable and its populations continuou to decline.

You probably remember this hilarious moment from /When Harry Met/ Sally. Then she tells you her stories, you tell her stories. Well this rediculus /romcom/ scene is an indicative of a real and very serious sport which you believe it or not , introduce our society to sport betting. Competitive walking better known as the pedestrianism started in the 1800s. Aristocrats about that time had a footmen whose job was to carry messages from one aristocrat to another. It was only a matter of time until the aristcrats started to make wagers on whose /footman/ was faster. Thus, the birth of sports betting as we know it. Competitive walking grew into a real sport event and reached its peak in 1870s and 1880s when spectators which showed up in superbowl like masses to see typical walk competitively. They have even filled up to the origianl Madison Square Garden. Sometimes races would last up to 6 days and the atmosphere was almost festival like. Brass bands played, venders sold pickled eggs, maybe some /roasted chestnuts/. Yum. The competitive drew everyone from celebraties to politions even regular /folk/. Champagne of all things was the drink of choice for walkers. They thought it was a stimulant. As one would, they drank it by the bottle. And guess what, it kinka worked.

The guy who made belt before David was this guy. Reggie Parks taking me under his wing, had everything to do with my development even my initial respect in this business from the veteran. Everybody met Reggie Parks, nobody /knew David M/. And here is how they are made. Step one, artwork. Step two, etching. Step three will be the bolt work. Step four, plating. And then from /there/ you pretty much have a complete belt although some have paint some don't have paint. It varies from /design to design /. And each belt is unique in its own/ way. I am actually been asked how many belts I have made by now we're in the /thousands/. Believe it or not,  WWE isn't his biggest /client/ right now.

Emergency room visits due to high heel shoe injuries double between 2002 and 2012. That's according to a study in the journal of foot and ankle surgery. Researchers estimate that during the period of study. American sustained more than a 123,000 high heel related ER worthy injuries. Almost 3 quarters of the demages was to the feet and ankles but wearers also hurt keens, shoulders and heads. Most of the injuries were minor. The research adds to a body of knowledge on the adverse affect /of/ heels. It's known them walking in them can reduce ankle muscle movements, stride length and balance. Long term, heel can alter the neural mechanics of walking and can lead to musculoskeletal disorders. But they look good and more than half of the American women and some men wear heels regularly. Most of the footwear foibles tracked in the study were suffered by women between ages 20 and 29. And perhaps surprisingly, the majority of the injuries did not happen while people were out on the town. They occur at home.

A common response to see ants inside your house is to stomp on it. But if you crash a member of ants specis /Tapinoma sessile/, you might catch a whiff of a strange smell. A smell that reminds some people of blue cheese, rancid butter, or rotten  cooknut. In fact the smell is so noticeable that the insects' common name is the odorous house ant and many people call it coconut ant. In an effort to figure out why people have these reactions, researchers /established/ visitors called North Carolina bug fest. 143 volunteers smells smooshed ants and were asked to identify the scent from 4 choices. Blue cheese, Rancid butter, rotten coconut and other. /Although websites overwhelmingly called the smell of rotten coconut almost 40 percent of the human judges picked blue cheese and about 25% picked rotten coconut more than 30 percent went with the choice of other. The scientists then analyse the chamicals responsible for the ant odor as well as the smelly chamicals of blue cheese, fresh coconut and coconut buried underground for three days. It turns out that the chemistry of the ant scent is indeed the similar to the blue cheese and rotton coconut but not fresh coconut. And the researcher note that the pencillium microbes that turn coconut oil rancid are also involved in the production of blue cheese. The study is in the journal of American Entomologist.The researchers also know the the most common write in candidate as a description for the ant aroma was cleaning spray as one little girl told them the ants 'smell exactly like her doctor."

Hello there. Oh, watch the road, watch the road. I just want to tell you a little fun fact, did you know that the guy who invented /cruise/ control couldn't drive, he had good excuse. He was blind.
This is Ralph Teetor, he was an amazing guy. He lost his sight when he was a kid but he didn't slow down. He /excelled/ in school, and became a respected mechanical engineer. He had a talent of visualizing objects in his mind. It led to an amazing inventions such as early power /lawnmower/ and new version of the fishing pole. But his /crowning/ acheivement is /cruise control. The story goes like this. During WWII, the speed limit was set on 35 to save on gas and tires. Teetor's lawyer was driving him around and /kept/ having to brake to stay at 35 and that constant slowing down and speeding up /uncertain/ make our interpid inventor feel a little carsick. His blindness made him particularly sensitive to the motion. An inspiration struck, Ralph came up with an idea that we control the speed of the car without the driver having to touch the pedals. Thus the speedostat was born. Obviously that named by catch /on/. In 1958, the first car to use /R's invention/ came out. At first it was 86$ luxury features but over the years, /cruise/ control, as it came to be known, has became a stand part of the most cars. So the next time you are cruising down the road, remember Ralph Teetor, the genius, the engineer, the visionary.

One of the newest additions to the skyline of Hamburg, Germany is a concert hall fit for modern Mozart. The /Elbphilharmonie/ is considered one of the world most /largest/ and most acoustically advanced concert venues in the world. Made up of 3 concert halls, the Elbphilharmonie seats more than 2800 vistors. The great concert hall, the largest of the three halls has 10000 unique acustic panels that were designed by using computer algorithms to create the best possible sound. Each penal contains one million cells that shape the sound by either absorbing the waves or having them reverberate through space. The curved design of the cell can be seen replicated thoughout the entire building. Not to be outdone, the glass exterior of the Elbphilharmonie built atop a former warehouse is just as spectacular as the interior. The structure rises above the /Elbe/ River and mirrors the water wave and shine. To mark the opening night, the exterior featured a light show, timed to the music being played within the great hall. With multiple events almost everyday, the Elbphilharmonie is a must see for music and math lovers alike.

Adidas and Puma are 2 of biggest rivals in shoes. But did you know that their founders were 2 halves of once happy family business that turned into a level of brother rage so intense it will get the sneakers heads' tongues a wagging/. See what I did there?
In the 1930's the Dassler brother sports shoe company in Bavaria made the most kick ass of atheletic shoes in all the /land/. The company even gave a pair of shoes to Jesse O to compete the 36th Olympics. When Jessie won, the brother shoes blew up. But all that success was not good for their relationship . Tensions flared. Some say they were stealing, affairs, resentment. And after WWII, the brothers were so out of step that they eventually ended the company. in 1949, Adolf or Adi Dassler formed Adidas a play on his /nickname/. Rodolf Dassler started Puma because that name is awsome. The brothers sued each other many many times over the years over all sorts of design of trademark issues costing each other a fortune and lawyers and suits. Their 2 factories built in the same /Bavarian/ village /Herzogenaurach/, polarizing the community with local people picking size by picking shoes. The brothers died 2 years apart. They were buried at the opposite ends at the village graveyard. Proof that even in death, there remained a great bitter divide between them. And so it was for decades until 2009. Employees of Adidas and Puma in the village where the 2 companies still had their headquarters came together and played a friendly soccor match and started the process of healing decades of enmity and began a new era of love and shoes.

At the top of the track right before a race, I tell myself there's nothing I can't do. People have died of doing this and I know that. But going at 90miles/hour is so damn /fun/. My name is John Daly, and I am a 2 time Olympic skeleton slider. The skeleton track is roughly one mile long and I slide up to 90 miles per hour, my face only one inch off the ice. You got a green light and you take off sprinting and you can't hear a thing. When I make contact with the sled it feels like a place I have been my whole life. Last year I made the same jump on that sled. You could feel immense pressure as you are pulling 5 Gs, so my 8 pound head now weights more that 40 pounds. If you start to get stiff, you start to get scared. It's not gonna work the sled gonna would break loose /on you/ and you're gonna crash. You have to enbrace the speed instead of getting afraid of it. At the bottom of the skeleton race when I have had a really good run, I feel like I can run through the wall. You are so pumped up and that's why I love it.

What do you think happens when 2 black holes meet?
When 2 supermassive black holes get near each other, their gravity draws them closer and closer. Gravity also pulls in a doughut shaped disc of gas from the surrounding galaxy. This gas heats up and radiates jets of lights we can see from across the universe. These jets are the most luminuous objects in the sky. As the black holes circle in towards each other, their magnetic fields show in white becoming intertwined. Eventually when the 2 supermassive objects get close enough, they suddenly plunge towards each other and fuse into one large black hole. The merger releases not just a torrent of light, but also gravitational waves that spiral outwards and /warp/ the entire fabric of space and time. Scientists hope one day /soon/ to capture one of these waves which might review secrets about the nature of gravity and foundamental workings of the universe.

Nothing says Britain more than, no, no, no, keep going, oh, yes, a nice cup of tea. We know we have China to thank for introducing tea to the western world, but how did it make its way to England and become the culture obsession it is today? Well, that all thanks to one Portugese woman. The year 1662, the person, Catherine of Braganza. She just won a hand that England's kings Charles the second with the help of the very large dowry including money, treasures and spicies. This worthwhile trade make her the queen of England, Scottland and Irland. When she arrived in her new homeland, she brought with her packets of loose leaf tea, /in crates labeled/ the label transporte de ervas aromaticas. It's a theory that these words was later abbreviated to tea. Now it could be found in England but was only /really used for medicinal purposes. Catherine continue drinking tea to her heart's content and as the new royal, everthing about her including her /beverage habbit was/ copied by other ladies, desperate to be just like their idol. Another thing Catherine brought to the table from Portugal was the idea of tea drinking experience. She popularized the use of porcelain teacups and mugs but the end of the 17th century, much of British /aristocracy/ were enjoying the hot beverage and soon enough, so was everyone else. Today, well tea can be found pretty much everywhere, it remains a special daily pastime for the /Brits/. So carry on and drink tea, people of England.

Nothing in Portugal stands out quite like the viberant colors and unusual architecture of Pena Palace. Pana National Palace is located within the western Portugal Sintra Mountains. Although the palace's vary design choices maked it appears as though it had been built from multiple pieces of different castles. The building's unusual style is the result of an owner which extremely flamboyant tastes. The palace was owned by King Ferdinand II, who built it to serve as a summer home for the Portugese royals in the late 18th century. The castle itself is built around /an old/ monastery and it is made up of colored sections including a red clock tower and yellow /minaret/. During the revolution in 1910, the royals fled and the palace and its ground was abandoned. It wasn't until the 20th century that it was restored by the state and earn itself a / UNESCO heritage site / designation. King Ferdinand's wide ranging tastes had made Pena palace a microcosm for all the styles of architecture the world has to offer.

The universe is a cold dark place, but it has a strange region that is even colder than usual. Seen from the earth, it is an area where the ambiant cosmic microwave background light the left over thermal energy of the big bang is much chillier than expected. Now the astronomers said they have found in the same part of space a so called supervoid, a large area mostly empty of galaxies. And they think the overlap is no coinsidence. The supervoid extends one point 8 billion light year across, making it perhaps the largest structure known in the /cosmos/. According to our report in the monthly notices of royal of astronomical society. The supervoid relative lack of stuff could have drained the energy from the light from past through it, explaining why the microwaves background is colder there. Here is how it works. General relativity theory tells us the gravity bends spacetime causing light to travel a curve path of massive objects as if falling into a bowl. The supervoid then with its lack of mass is akin to a hill. When light travels up to that hill, it loses energy. Normally it would regain energy upon exiting the void. That is when it comes down the other side of the hill. But because the expansion of the space is accelerating, the hill light tumbles down is less steep than it was when the light climbed up and the flutter ride down means less energy recovered than was expanded going up which translates to a low energy region. A big chill in the remnant to the big bang.

My name is Michael Lombardi and I am a diving safety officer at the American museum of natural history. The suit is made of a hard aluminum and it is cast alumi alloy so you are essentially inside a pressure vessel, you are inside a submarine that space is not compressible so that's really the key with removing pressure.

So we eliminate the problems with physiology, we open up a whole new demension for exploration. All the life support is self contained on the suit itself. You are essentially using a oxigen rebreather there inside the cabin so you are reclying the cabin gas by carbon dioxides is removed chamically and oxigen is replenished to match your metabolic rate well while at work or at rest. If we were to wet dive to be these same depths, it would require a very complex use of mixed gas, so typically, nitrogen oxigen and helium to dive very deep. I have had a lot of experience doing that and you end up against a wall very quickly in terms of how much time you have and depths to do these things and so in the exosuit you are at surface pressure. You reclying the cabin gas supply and you breathing the same atmosphere as you are here. And you have you know 50 hour supply of.

Then in 1236 the city of /Cordoba/ came under Christian rule and /Mezquita/ was converted to a church. 4 centuries later, a cathedral was constructed in the centre and it became a home for the town's Roman catholics. Well the cathedral of next example of classic catholic broque architecture, the majority of // construction is the result of the work of Islamic architects. Features like 856 columns and symmetrical arches give you illusion of infinite space. These elements are examples of why // is considered one of the greatest accomplishments in /Islamic/ architecture in the world. Today it is just a UNESCO world heritage site over a million people visit every year and after all its history, it is now seen as a site of religious significance to both catholics and muslisms.

The closest star from our solar system is about 4.3 light years away from earth. But how do we know that distance? It seems like measuring a star distance should be impossible. It is not like we stretch out a cosmic tape from here to /aldebaran/, a giant red star that's over 400 trillion miles away. Fortunately we have triangles. Try this, shift to the left then to the right. Everything in front of you appears to be back and forth. But objects that are far away move less than the stuff nearby. This effect is called parallax and we can use it to measure large distances. As our planet goes around the sun, the shift seems to go back and forth relative to more distance stars. The farther away the star is, the less it moves. The shift is incredibly tiny. The closest star to our sun moves no more than a width of a soccor ball seen from 40 miles away. By looking at a star in January and then again in July we can draw a triangle. The base is the diameter of the earth's orbit. The opposite angle is how far the star appears to shift. Dig some high school trigonometry and you can calculate the triangle's height which in this case is the distance to the star. knowing these distances, let's measure other things like the brightness of stars and the size of the galaxies. It's so essential in 2013, the European space agency launched a telescope called Gaia to measure parallex with more precision that we've every seen. Above the turbulence above the earth's atmosphere, G has been plotting a distances to over a billion stars, creating the map of the milky way and some of its galactic neighbors. All that from the lowly triangle.
