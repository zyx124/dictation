High above a town in France sits a beautiful chapel. It's a long way to the top but you know what they say? The bigger the clime, the closer to god. Chapel /Saint Michel d'Aiguihe/, otherwise known as the Saint Michael of the needle. It is located in Le puy-en Velay//, a town roughly 6 hours away from Paris. Built in top a distinct volcanic plug that is believed to have formed over 2 million years ago, this church is nearly 300 feet from the ground and it is dedicated to the archangel Michael. The church is commissioned by a /bishop/ in the year 951 who wanted to commemorate the his thousands mile journey back from the Pyrenees mountain range. On average the site recieves just over 65,000 visitors each year and at 268 steps, the climb to the top is long but the view is quite a reward with the 360 degree look at the town including the surrounding volcanic formations.

PDT used a White House event to pay tribute to Federal Immigration officials returning to the fight of US southern border. The president is making border security as a key part of his message as he tried to maintain the control of GOP congress in the fall elections. First lady Melania Trump opened a conference on cyber bulling by urging companies to give more opportunities to kids to share ideas on /combating/ cyber bullying and fostering good citizenship on line. The first lady has come in for a criticism due to the president's use of twitter to berate his enemies. Italian police has released a security camera footage showing the exact moment of last week'd Genoa bridge collapse that left dozens dead and hundreds injured the footage shows traffic moving beneath the bridge just seconds before part of the structure collapses. Hundreds of South and North Korean family members forced to live apart for decades due to the Korean war embraced at an emotional reunion Monday in NK. It's happening amid a push for bad relation between the 2 Koreas.

The theory of general relativity is what made Albert Einstein famous. To get the basics, we brought Einstein to the beach.
It turns out that the gravity is not quite what we thought it was. Instead of a force pulling two objects together, gravity, according to relativity, results from the shape of space and time. E figured out that space and time are just different dimensions of one entity. Spacetime is kinda like this hammock. We live in the dimensions of 3 in space and one of time. In the absence of mass, space is flat and objects travelling through it, moving a straight line. But E showed that when you add mass including planet, people and even coconut, it warps the fabric of spacetime. Spacetime bends around mass and becomes curve and objects travelling through and no longer follow a straight line. Now it has to travel in a curve. This curve path brings it closer to the large mass making it seems the objects that are drawing together. This is the effect we know as gravity and it is the core of general relativity.

PDT's personal attorney Michael Cohen has pleaded guilty to federal charges including campaign finance fraud, band fraud and tax evasion. Cohen entered the plea in federal court in NY on Tuesday.Former T campaign /chair/ Paul Manafort has been found guilty on 8 counts on financial fraud. The judge cleared a mistrial on 10 other counts after juror's /fail to reach a/ verdict. Prosecutors have until Aug 29 to decide whether they will retry the other 10 counts. No sentencing date has been set. The father of a Colorado women who police say was killed by her husband /sobbed/ with /his face/ in his hand as the judge of former charges. Chris M was charged with first degree murder for killing his wife and 2 daughters. If convicted, Wat could face death penalty. In /Ardansas/, a 3 three year old boy and his one year old brother survived alone about 2 days after they were passengers in the single car /wreck/ that killed their mother in /south Arkansas/. The investigators believe the // happens 2 days earlier and that older boy was able to climb out of the /wreckage/, the younger boy was taken out to children's hospital to be treated for dehydration but its condition isn't life threatening.

Tornadoes occur in every continent except Antarctica but more forms in central US than anywhere else in the zone called tornado alley. That is because the conditions in the alley are ideal for creating tornadoes. Warm humid air, low to the ground moves north from /gulf/ of Mexico in collides with cool dry air high above the ground rolling in from the Rocky mountains. The collision of air masses creates a supercell, a massive thunderstorm that has a strong rotating updraft of air. Scientists aren't exactly sure what happens next but the leading idea goes like this. The difference in speed between the faster high winds and slower low winds causes the air to rotate the horizontal axis. If one end of the rolling air gets caught on the /updraft is bent upward and forms a /funnel/ cloud. Its spin gets tighter and faster and the cloud gets longer. Rain or /hail/ from the thunder storm can then push down on the tail of the funnel cloud until it reach the ground forming a tornado. Top wind speed of most tornados is usually under 110 miles an hour and most touch the ground in less in 10 minutes. However, extreme tornados are truely extreme. The longest tornado path was cut by the tristate tornado on /Mar 18th/, 1925. It tore up property in 219 miles and it was on the ground for /well over/ 3 hours and killed 747 people. Which is why I'll be hanging out in here in Antarica with the penguins until tornado season is over.

The WH says PDT did nothing wrong the day after his attorney Michael Cohen /said T direct/ him to make hush money payments to 2 women with the express purpose of influencing the eleciton. WH spokeswoman Sarah S /stresses/ there is no charge against the president. Democratic national committee says it has stopped an attempt to hack its database the houses information on tens of millions of voters across the country. The party officials says no information was compromised but it was not clear what third party was attempted the hack. Hurricane L has taken a turn towards Hawaii but was weakened as it approaches the islands The national weather service says the hurricane will still pack a wallop/ for Hawaii on Thursday before gradually slowing on the next two days. One of the least /wired/ countries, the island of Cuba is getting mobile internet access in a tentative but significant opening off communication. The state tele company made mobile internet available at no cost started in early Wednesday as what is described as the test of the network.

You don't need a telescope to /taking the stars/ at our milky way galaxy, but planet are much harder to see. Campared to stars,  /exo/planet are faint and tiny so most are detected by indirect methods. For example, many /exoplanets have been found by the so called radio velocity method. This methods detects the small gravitational pull that the planet exerts on their neighbouring stars. The stars movement change its color, making the light bluer the stars towards of and redder as it recedes away. Astronomers detect unseen planets by measuring the subtle changes in star light which we call the Doppler effect. Another tactic is called the Micro lensing. Einstein general theory of relativity tells us massive objects bend light race like lens. When two stars align, the stars that's farther away becomes magnified. What astronomers see the feedback star brighten and then fade. But planets can bent these lights too, so they tweak the symmetry of magnifying lens. Now the faint star bightens and fades in a more herky jerky pattern, revealing an unseen planet. Astronomers can also find planets by transit search. This is how NASA's Kepler spacecraft detects planets by the dozen. Each time a planet passes through Kepler's field of view, it blocks a tiny portion of star light, dimming the star ever so slightly. So although the planet is too samll to be seen, its presence is felt. With so many different ways as to finding exoplanets, austronomers are discovering new worlds all the time, whether they can see them or not.

Toostie rolls seems simple enough. That piece of gooey chocolate wrapped up in perfect little bite. But believe it or not, these tasty treats saved lives of the US marines in the Korean war. In 1950, as the Korea Chosin reservoir, US marine troops were engaged in battle. But marine were running out of /ammunition/ and called for a air drop in 60 milimeter /mortar rounds/. Code name to these bullets, Tootsie Roll. When the supplies fell from the sky, troops were surprised to find the boxes filled actual candies. Where are the bullets? This /fluke/ turned out to be blessing in disguise. Freezing cole temperature have been cracked vehicle fuel lines /leaving/ troop /stranded/. And although the candies were frozen, they softened easily in the mouths of servicemen. Marine quickly realized that they could melt the candy to a putty and seal the broken pipes. Good as new. When the choclates refrozed, they were able to drive to newly functional vehicles. The marine successfully escaped the resouvior and admit that the /Tootsie ROlls had/ a big hand in their survival and they called themselves the chosin few. I have called that a pretty sweet victory.

One interesting property of superconductor is that they can levitate magnet. The cube shown here is a magnet only 2.4 millimeters long on each side. And it is floating above a superconducting material cooled by liquid nitrogen. The magnets' magnetic field sets up an electrical current the superconductor. These currents block the magnetic field from penetrating the superconductor. This causes the field to /active/ visible cushion on which the magnet floats. The magnets does not drift away because of inpurities in the superconductor. These inpurities like the magnetic field passed through in some spots, locking the magnets in place. When you try to move the magnet, it stays put. But you can cause it to spin like a /top/. There is almost no friction, so in theory, it could spin forever. Read more about superconductors and their connection to unified theory of physics in the Jan 2013 issue of scientific American.
