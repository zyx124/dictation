High above a town in France sits a beautiful chapel. It's a long way to the top but you know what they say? The bigger the clime, the closer to god. Chapel /Saint Michel d'Aiguihe/, otherwise known as the Saint Michael of the needle. It is located in Le puy-en Velay//, a town roughly 6 hours away from Paris. Built in top a distinct volcanic plug that is believed to have formed over 2 million years ago, this church is nearly 300 feet from the ground and it is dedicated to the archangel Michael. The church is commissioned by a /bishop/ in the year 951 who wanted to commemorate the his thousands mile journey back from the Pyrenees mountain range. On average the site recieves just over 65,000 visitors each year and at 268 steps, the climb to the top is long but the view is quite a reward with the 360 degree look at the town including the surrounding volcanic formations.
