High above a town in France sits a beautiful chapel. It's a long way to the top but you know what they say? The bigger the clime, the closer to god. Chapel /Saint Michel d'Aiguihe/, otherwise known as the Saint Michael of the needle. It is located in Le puy-en Velay//, a town roughly 6 hours away from Paris. Built in top a distinct volcanic plug that is believed to have formed over 2 million years ago, this church is nearly 300 feet from the ground and it is dedicated to the archangel Michael. The church is commissioned by a /bishop/ in the year 951 who wanted to commemorate the his thousands mile journey back from the Pyrenees mountain range. On average the site recieves just over 65,000 visitors each year and at 268 steps, the climb to the top is long but the view is quite a reward with the 360 degree look at the town including the surrounding volcanic formations.

PDT used a White House event to pay tribute to Federal Immigration officials returning to the fight of US southern border. The president is making border security as a key part of his message as he tried to maintain the control of GOP congress in the fall elections. First lady Melania Trump opened a conference on cyber bulling by urging companies to give more opportunities to kids to share ideas on /combating/ cyber bullying and fostering good citizenship on line. The first lady has come in for a criticism due to the president's use of twitter to berate his enemies. Italian police has released a security camera footage showing the exact moment of last week'd Genoa bridge collapse that left dozens dead and hundreds injured the footage shows traffic moving beneath the bridge just seconds before part of the structure collapses. Hundreds of South and North Korean family members forced to live apart for decades due to the Korean war embraced at an emotional reunion Monday in NK. It's happening amid a push for bad relation between the 2 Koreas.

The theory of general relativity is what made Albert Einstein famous. To get the basics, we brought Einstein to the beach.
It turns out that the gravity is not quite what we thought it was. Instead of a force pulling two objects together, gravity, according to relativity, results from the shape of space and time. E figured out that space and time are just different dimensions of one entity. Spacetime is kinda like this hammock. We live in the dimensions of 3 in space and one of time. In the absence of mass, space is flat and objects travelling through it, moving a straight line. But E showed that when you add mass including planet, people and even coconut, it warps the fabric of spacetime. Spacetime bends around mass and becomes curve and objects travelling through and no longer follow a straight line. Now it has to travel in a curve. This curve path brings it closer to the large mass making it seems the objects that are drawing together. This is the effect we know as gravity and it is the core of general relativity.

Tornadoes occur in every continent except Antarctica but more forms in central US than anywhere else in the zone called tornado alley. That is because the conditions in the alley are ideal for creating tornadoes. Warm humid air, low to the ground moves north from /gulf/ of Mexico in collides with cool dry air high above the ground rolling in from the Rocky mountains. The collision of air masses creates a supercell, a massive thunderstorm that has a strong rotating updraft of air. Scientists aren't exactly sure what happens next but the leading idea goes like this. The difference in speed between the faster high winds and slower low winds causes the air to rotate the horizontal axis. If one end of the rolling air gets caught on the /updraft is bent upward and forms a /funnel/ cloud. Its spin gets tighter and faster and the cloud gets longer. Rain or /hail/ from the thunder storm can then push down on the tail of the funnel cloud until it reach the ground forming a tornado. Top wind speed of most tornados is usually under 110 miles an hour and most touch the ground in less in 10 minutes. However, extreme tornados are truely extreme. The longest tornado path was cut by the tristate tornado on /Mar 18th/, 1925. It tore up property in 219 miles and it was on the ground for /well over/ 3 hours and killed 747 people. Which is why I'll be hanging out in here in Antarica with the penguins until tornado season is over.
