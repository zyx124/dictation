You might blame your pets for shedding all over the house, but we humans do it too. And our stuff is alive.
We are constantly /emitting/ microbes around us and this is coming from shedding of our skin, from exhaling, you know our hair we're just full of these guys. Adam Altrichter, a microbial ecologist at the University of /Oregon/. We have never been sterile organisms. We are definitely masses of microbes, both in and on us. Biologists estimate that we shed a million paraticles an hour including, a course, a lot of /bacteria/. /Altrichter/ and his colleagues wanted to measure that cloud of particles, so they asked 11 volunteers not to shower, /dress/ them in shorts and tank tops/ and put them in a sterile chamber of hours at a time while collecting microbial samples on surfaces and in the air. What they found those samples was a menagerie of bacteria from the volunteers' skin, guts, genital tracts, lungs, noses and mouths. And for 8 of 11 study subjects, microbial cloud was unique enough to identify the individual who /left it/, suggesting its baterial fingerprint for someday be used in /forensics/. The study is in the journal PeerJ. Given that we spend 90 percent of our lives indoors are microbial cloud also colonizes the place we live and work. And yes, the people around us. It is kinda interesting to think about how the people that we are interact with at work or in classrooms or in other environments  how we could be sharing some of these microbe passengers between us, not even knowing anything about it. And now that you do know about it. Hopefully your view of your co workers won't become clouded.

This butterfly is as elusive as it is beautiful and the briliance of its blue wings are only invisible when it opens /them/. The wings are distinctive with their brilliant silver blue color. The butterfly was thought to be extinct in 1990s when it seems to disappear without a trace. It wasn't until the 1990s that this visually striking butterfly was spotted again. Biologists were surprised and delighted in its existance and a breeding program was begun to build up the specis. Though captive breeding has helped bolster numbers, the population is still low enough to remain at an endangered list. Through careful nuturing and management, this small but mighty butterfly has a fighting chance. This is the Palos Verdes Blue butterfly.

This is the eastern Bongo. These beautiful chestnut and white striped creatures can only be found in 4 isolated regions in Kenya. Eastern bongos are fairly large in size and can weigh anywhere from 500 to 900 pounds and their horns can be as long as 40 inches. In fact, their horns are as wide as the widest part of their body. Desipite their size, eastern bongos are rather timid creatures. They are herbivores. They tend to eat and are most active during twilight and dusk as the darkness helps them to hide from predators. There is estimated to be about 100 bongos left in the wild, putting them well below the critically endangered threshold. Their biggest threats are hunting and destruction of their habitat. In an effort to protect these eastern bongo, varies parts of native habitat in Kenia has been designated as shelter for them, allowing the eastern bongo to move about freely and safely without fear of poachers. This is the eastern bongo.

The monument features are the statue of the king, lions, eagles and various Greek, Armenian and Medes gods, with each measuring almost 30 feet tall. The heads of these sculptures once sat atop of these bodies but at some point in time, they were removed. Nemrut Dag went lost to memory and until it was once rediscovered a geologist in 1881 and in 1987, it was designated as the UNESCO world Heritage site.

This is the ocean twilight zoon. More than 30 meters below the surface, coral reef still flourish in the gloom. But these deep reefs could be under threat from powerful force, hurricanes. Scientists have long known that the shallow reefs are vulnerable to hurricanes with the corals torn apart as the winds /stir up the sea/. But the reefs of the twilight zoon, have been assumed to be protected from the worst effects. These deeper reefs have also been thought to /provide/ in a temperary refuge, for shallow reef specious which could shelter the deep water. But new research is telling a different story. Scientists in Puerto Rico/ have been studying reefs both before and after Hurricane Maria, a particularly violent storm. They have already shown that the hurricane caused currents and upwellings deep into the twilight zoon. Next they plan to assess the demage to the deeper coral's directly in Maria's path. The deep reaching effects of strong hurricanes would be bad news for specious on the hunt for somewhere to weather the storm. Of course coral reefs have been surviving hurricanes for millennia. But extreme weather events are getting more common as climate changes. Human activity is also causing ocean acidification and warming. This can lead to diaseases and coral bleaching. The recent research suggests that the deep reefs could be just as vulnerable as the shallow ones. Coral reefs provide coast lines with a /line/ of defense against storms, so losing this delicate resource could add yet more pressure to regions already devastated by the effects of climate change.

In the 2016 presidential election, the result look something like this, which surprise many people as pre election polls have predicted it would go like that. Experts are analyzing what happened, but now here are some of the math that underpins polling. If we want to know how many /octopuses/ and /ostriches/ there were in this group, we could count each of them and the octopuses make 60% of the population. But it's impractical to get in touch with every individual so instead we can sample a subset and extrapolate with statistics. If we take a look at 10 animals, most of the time, we will count 6 octopuses. Some times it would be five or seven, but it would rare to find a sample where only 2 animals were octopuses. Statisticians have formulas to map this is a curve where the area underneath the curve represents the probability of seeing that result from the sample of the population. The center of the peak is the most likely result, 60%. But the real number could be spilitly higher or slightly lower due to random chance in the samples we drew. That is called statistical error. Getting more data from larger sample pools decreases that error, narrowing the peak around the likely true value. But there is also another form of error, systematic error. You might be sampling in a way that /accidentally/ capture too many ostrishes or the samples of the group over and over, counting the same individual more than once. /it can get/ complicated. Say we want to know a group of animals, prefers orange or purple. If they voted, 62% of the animals would prefer purple. The octopuses of the colors are just about equally. Ostrishes favor purple and that makes our polling more difficult. We can test that reference in polling data by using a chi square, a common statistical tool that tests how likely it is that preference that due to chance. If we assume that the ostriches have the equal chance to liking purple and orange and samples that we polled deviate that assumption. We can calculate the likelyhood of its real trend ostriches, not a random /fluke. Then we see orange /preferring ostrich/ in our poll, we can weight it differently, claiming it doesn't represent typical ostrish vote. Polls can try to ferret out how populations thinks and might act but the best way to learn these animal's preferences is still to have them to vote.

On the trip to Massachussete, Franklin noticed that the good people in Boston were much more fire savvy than his fellow citizens of Philadelpha. This got Ben thinking and he came up an idea to creat a club or society of active men belonging each fire engine whose business is to attend all fires with it whenever they happen. When Ben got weired, he wrote an anonymous letter to newspaper as a senior citizen titled "protections of towns of fire". Dear Pensylvania Gazette. The letter encouraged a better fire safety plan, and painted a horrifying alternative. People jumping out of the windows, breaking their necks and being burned alive. But it worked, in 1796, the first volunteering American fire office was borned. The union fire company, it was comprised of 30 volunteers and you might know some of them, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Samuel Adams. That's right, our founding fathers were also fire fighters. Soon after, fire companies and clubs sprang all over Philadelphia, then across the 13 colonies. So thanks to the matchless leadership of Benjamin Franklin, we now have fire fighters.

It's not very many people really know, but the great lakes has thousands of /shipwrecks/. In Wisconsin for sure, we know we have 750 of historic /shipwreck/ losses. My name is Caitlin Zant and I am a maritime archaeologist for the /Wisconsin Historical/ society. I would say the main goal of what we do in martime archaeology is to preserve our maritime history and the history of the United States in general. The ships are quite sturdy but they have also been underwater for a hundred and hundred and fifty years. Our shipwrecks/ don't dissappear over time as they do in the oceans. The fresh water that's very cold, acturally does a very good job for preserve the shipwrecks. One of the really great things about the lake Michigan that makes it really unique is the fact that you do have fresh clear water. You can see many times espesially in deep wrecks of 100 to 150 feet. When you were down there looking at the shipwreck, you start to think all the sailors that sailed on it or if it's a passenger, the passenger that happened to be on it. You can still find pieces of clothings and in certain areas, buttons, shoes and so that really gives the insight of the life of these sailors. There is definitely a little bit of the /thrill of/ discovery. When we go down on the ship, even on the ship we know, we think we know what it is. They are still always that little sense of excitement that you are gonna to find something that no one else has seen before.

Fear to me means absolutely nothing anymore. Fear place such a big piece of my life and controled me to not do what was best for me. So fear to me now is nothing but an imagination. I am Fllip Rodriguez, I am a hollywook stuntman and I am an American enjoyer. In the age of 15, I was sexually abused by my father, how do I live my life after that? Like I can't trust anybody. I got into Parkour free /running when I was in the age of 19. P to different definition are similar, Parkour is a straightforward // jumping over walls, over any obstacles in your way. Free running is your own freestyle, your own flipping, flowing over // as pretty as possiple and you take your time. When I first got started, I have never been upside down. To my body it's like, wait, woo, we don't do that, and the fear /aspects/ kicks in, so it's like 'let's stop get in', this is really worse getting hurt. Fear is what stopped em from trying to stop my sexual abuse. Parkour free running has been step stone for me to heal and be okay with my sexual abuse because fear is a big part of Parkour free running so everyday I trained and I was always encountering new fear. I started the American Ninja Warrior and in season 7 was actually my story. After my interview came on, I have one of the kids write to me: one of my parents which // to me turns out that the daughter or son were sexually abused by family or friend. The child started breaking out crying. She's like /what Fllip was talking about/ had also happened to me and they brought up charges the gentleman got convicted of that / and that right/ there blew my mind away because not only did I heal myself but I also save somebody from further abuse and that was incredible. I like to /get back to / the community of /using/ my story. I coach // Parkour free running. I am not just teaching them about Parkour free running, I tried to teach them tools of lives. You guys are // you kinda felt a little bit, what you gotta say? I don't give up and I gotta turn this right up again because // taught us to never give up. Every single person can relate to fear.

What would you rather have? A new car or this fish. It turns out that they cost aorund the same. A single dragon fish can go for tens of thousands of dollars. So what's so special about it? Well it might not look it. This endangered fish is so /coveted/, people have actually gone to prison over it. 
THe dragon fish gets its nickname for how it resembles a dragon in flight as it swims. However, its real name is the Asian Arowana. It's a freshwater fish native to southest asia.  And it has taken the aquarium market by storm. Today these fishes are so prized and some of them even have their own motorcades //. And /breeders protect their stock/ are protected with layers of concrete completed with guard dogs and watchmen. There's even a cosmetic surgery to help // fish who needs eye lips or /chin tucks/. That may sound like overkill  but it's really not. It's a very valuable commodity and that have driven tremendous amount of crimes around the areas where its bred. 
This is Emily v. who explore this world for her book 'The dragon behind the glass'. We are talking murder and midnight fish /anpping/. This wasn't the case of the fish however. Up until the second half of the 20th century, these fish weren't/ flaunted/. They were fileted and eated by locals. And in 1967, an acquirium trader traveled through Malaysia saw a dead /arowana/ at the food market and found its so attractive and he /sought one/ out as key as a pet. But in 1980s, Mariwana has turned up in TW and eventually, people all over Asia wanted one. In particular, the red and gold variety of arowana came to symbolize luck and wealth in several asian cultures.

While the mine is now closed, it stands the testment to the small town's perseverence against harsh harsh Siberian  winters. Building a mine is a difficult task. It took seven years of miners battling winters for seven months of the year. The temperature hit below freezing and digging is impossible for the frozen ground.

If you drive in the city,you have no doubt about the frustration circling after block after block after block, /cruising/ for parking. But scientists used to study that phenomenon have a solution to free up more spots. You make them more expensive for people to have decide to park farther away and pay less or closer and pay more. It is //, a system scientist at // university. San Fransisco has piloted the program like that raises parking rates based on demand and it has been shown to reduce cruising. But the sensor required the systems to spend millions of dollars to  install and operate, B says. So instead, writing in IEEE /intelligent transportation/ system magzine, /he and his colleague/ write an algorithm/ that can determine the smart prices without the use of sensors. They tested it in Israel city in //. First, they divide the city by the zones. They estimated the parking demand in each zones by calculating the apartment by the offices there and then they factored the parking supplying in the area along with how wealthy the potential parker might be. Using that data, the algorithm suggested that pricing for each zone, they were guarentee 90 percent occupancy rate of parking spot city wide, meaning 10 percent of the spots are always available for drivers willing to price, regardless of neighbourhood. Of course, not everyone aggrees that jacking up prices will ease driver frustrations. Like last time B // for city  residents, I got about 100 /reactions on the web/ but 99 of them said they have never seen such a stupid /statement from the professors/ and I should be punished and fired. Ultimately, he says it will up to the cities themselves to gaugeeach residents political appetites for an easier parking spot.

You may have heard the saying that early birds get the worm. But when /it comes/ to human, do morning people really have an advantage over night owls? Does one come out on top as more intelligent and successful than the other in the battle of bed time? The somewhat surprising truth is that we have little say in sleep preference, as it's almost entirely genetically predetermined. Chances are, if you are a nightly owl, it was likely passed down from an ancestor who was also a night owl.  From evolutionary perspective it make sense. Having individuals with various sleep patterns would allow better protection of a group throughout the day and night. Instead of everybody sleeping at one time, some people naturally stay up later and some awake earlier aware of threats or predators while other sleep. But considering most modern societal activities happen between 9 am to 5 pm, it may seem that night owls are put at a disadvantage. And researchers have also coin/ the term social jetlag to describe sleep deprivation many experience to accomodate social norms. 



For night owls, the social jetlag feels like living a different time zone every single day. Considering chronically sleep deprivation has a directly effect on brain functioning, it's no surprise that studies/ report night owls university students have lower overall grades. Not to mention early birds tends to determine more positive social traits, such as being /proactive/ and optimistic and are less prone to depression, or addiction to /nicotine/, alchol and food. We also see these traits represented physically in the brain, particularly the white matter which help neurons communicate. 



Night owls exhibit significantly less white matter and as a result there are few pathways for /feel good/ hormones such as serotonin and dopamine to traval through but it's not all bad for the late /nighters/, in fact they tend to be much more creative having been found higher cognitive abilities and are known to be risk takers. What they lack in white matter, they make up in cortisol levels. This stress hormone gets your body ready to face threats, contributing to their risk taking behavior which studies show can translate oppotuntities and potentially more financial gain. 



Further more, even the morning people can be energetic right after waking, they tend to lose steam faster than night owls throughout the day. Both sides perform equally well in /reaction action/ test an hour after waking. But after ten hours being awake, night owls performs significantly better. Your inner clock is regulated by many proteins which is created from various genes in your DNA. Studys have even shown that a single change in the gene code near gene called Per1 can result an hour difference in your waking time. As crazy as it seems, scientists also found a correlations between the same gene and the time of death. The early risers are more likely to die around 11 am while the night owls were more likely to die before 6 pm. What about teenager, / you say/ ? It's true most tend to be the night owls due to the hormone changes during puberty/. But this tends to wane out into  your genetic default as you enter  your adulthood. So while there may be some truth to early birds get the worm, night owls are exactly lagging behind in life, they are just lagging behind the time.

From twig to electrical toothbrushes, humans have been cleaning their teeth since ancient Egyptians in 5000 BCE. But what if you just straight up stopped brushing your teech at all for the rest of your life? Within miniutes of stopping, the food  debris and moist environment from your siliva creates an ideal environment for bacteria to survive. Streptococci is one of  the most common bacteria found in our mouth and it's normally not harmful until it metabolizes sugar or protein from food debris. But after a  whole day, these bacteria would have already produced significant amounts of /plague/ from sugars. Plague is the slimy layer of biofilm that you can feel when you accidentally forget to brush  sometimes. And this plague actually helps the bacteria adhere to your teeth which allows them to produce even more plague creating a cycle of bacterial and plague build up. 

After a week, all these build up will cause some /pretty/  serious bad breath. Not to mention  that the plague begin to harden to form tartar that lead your teeth to appearing yellow. At this point, you are also causing significance damage to tooth enamel as the bacteria break down sugar to produce lactic acid. Enamel is the hard mineralized outer layer of the outer tooth and once it breaks down, you cannot make it anymore. After a month, your decaying teeth will form cavities. These holes in your teeth get deeper and deeper if left untreated leading to gingivitis an early form of gum diseases. This is because the immune system is attacking your /gum/ and teeth in response to the bacteria build up. Your cavities will fill up pus witch is a protein-rich fluid /filled with/ dead white blood cells  and your gums will be extremely sensitive by this point, turing red when you touch it and bleeding with any significant pressure. 

After  an entire year of neglect, you now have peridontitis, inner layer of gum and bone are broken down by enzymes and pull away the teeth to form pockets which only further allow food debris and bacteria to gather. This causes the immune systems to get overdrive and destroy your gums and /ligments/ resulting in advanced peridontitis where your teeth become loose and begin to fall out. 

Any longer, any issues can spread beyond your mouth and injure your blood and causing inflammation throughout your organs and increasing your likelihood of erectile dysfunction a head and neck cancer, chronic heart disease and  even dementia development. Combining your lacking brushing and poor diet high /in processed / foods and expecially sugar, which is much more common now than early /homo sapiens would have experienced and you have a much more accelerating breeding ground for bacteria and putting your whole body health at risk.

In 1879, amateur archaeologist MA and his daughter explored a dark cave in northern Spain. When Maria wondered off by herself, she made an amazing discovery. They were standing in an ancient art, the walls and roof decorated in prehistoric paitings and graved paitings ranging from 19 to /35/ thousands years old. Similar marks of our ancestors have been preserved in cave all over the world. The oldest we have found were made up of 40 thousands years ago. What did these images tell us about the ancient human minds and the lives of their creators. 

These earlier artists mixed /clay/, mineral, charcoal and /ochre/ with spit/ or animal  fat to create paint. They drew with their hands and tools like pads of /moss/, twigs, bones and hair. In many instances, the images follows the contour of the caves to create depth and /shade/. Those common dipictions are of geometric shapes folowed by large mammals like bison, horses, /mammoths/, deer and /boars/.

 Human figures appear rarely, as well as occational hand /prints/. /Some have theorized that/ these artworks as creation of hunters or /of holy men in trance-like states. And we found examples created by men, women and children. Why did they create these art?

 Perhaps they are documenting what they knew of the world, like modern scientists or marking their tribal territory. Maybe the images are the culmination/ of sacred hunting rituals, or spiritual journeys or could they be art for art's sake, the /sheer joy/ and fulfillment of creation. As many unsolved of the mistery of the antient world, we may never know for sure /barring the/ invention of the time machine /, that is/. But while the answer remains elusive, these images are our earliest proof of human communication testifying the /human compacity creativity thousands of years before /writing/. They are distinctive visual language that images the world outside the self, just like modern art forms,  from /graffiti/ to painting, to /animated VR caves.

Do  you hear yanny or laurel? A recent twitter poll /found/  that 47% people hear yanny while 53% hear laurel. Clearly it is created into an argument that is dividing the /nation/. So what is the science behind the madness? One of the first aspects is  priming. If you are to play this clip without providing the option of yanny or laurel, you may have heard neither of these words. But if I am reading them you prime to hear one or the other.

Secondly, when you speak you are producing sound waves, which propagate through the air. This is a visual depiction of the sound waves of the original yanny /laurel recording, created by /Brad/ Story, a professor of speech, language and hearing. Here is the same depiction of laural, you can say that the acoustic picture of them are very similar. Here is the hearing saying yanny, the acoustic picture are also similar. So the word yanny and laurel are more similar audibly than you might think. Whether  you are listening on a laptop, phone or a headphone will influence what you hear based on sound quality. What if you hear on the same device but you hear different things that someone next to you? That might have something to do with your age or ear. The sound of frequency of yanny played at a higher frequency than the word laurel. As we age, we are less able to hear higher frequencies. So you hear yanny you might have younger ears.

For centuries, human has been using substances to ultra their state of mind, from caffine, cigrettes and alcohol to more extreme drugs. But the most illicit commonly used drug in NA, when /does/ marijuana fited in and how exactly does it exactly affect your brain.

First, we need to understand how the brain functions, the neurons are processor information in the brain. By releasing chamicals called neurotransmitters, from Axon of a neuron to the dendrite of another, they change the receiving electrical charge of the receiving neuron, consequenly exciting it or exihibiting it. If excited, the signals passed on. Though it sounds simple, the signals work together and effectively is quite compound into complex configuration within miliseconds. Flushing over the entire brain, this is what happens every single time you think, breath or move. So what is going on inside your brain when you smoke marijuana?

Well, unlike alcohol which contains molecules nothing like in our body, // contains molecules that resemble those produced in our // brains, cannabinoids. Though these cannabinoids naturally circulate in much lower quantities compared to the large amount of /influx  imposed / by smoking, specifically the chamical //, or THC, resembles the natural transmitter called annabinoids. These // are specialized neurotransmitters released by neuron by having just fire. Neuron temperarely become unresponsive after firing to prevent them  from overreacting or being too dominant. This allows your brains to function in a calm and controlled manner but connabinoids interrupt this approach in some parts of the brain, instead, they were removed /refractory period/ of the neurons are already active and cause your thoughts and imagination and perception to utterly magnified it self.

Iceland is geologically active, with hot rocks and steam just below the surface  and many places. A web of pipelines and a silver /geodesic/ domes in the  southwestern part of the island piggyback on these geothermal features to create power and also turn atmospheric carbon dioxide into rock. /Waste/ steam from the geothermal power plant powers filters that pull CO2 out of the air. Pipes /carry/ CO2  and water to a geo/desic dome/ where the /mixtures is injected/ more than 700 m underground in as little as a few months. In this little as /a few months/ , the basalt bedrock reacts with the injected gas and forms the /veins/ of carbonate minerals in the rock. The projects puts away just 50 tons of carbon / each year. So it's not a cure all for reaching negative /emissions/ yet. But it proves that the /air capture/ and underground CO2  can work.

Death sucks. But what happens to your body after you die is fascinating. So we are going to show you. Don't worry, it won't be /gross/ much. Once a person's breathing stops, the body cells stop receiving oxigen. The cells continue to live for several minutes generating CO2. CO2 is acidic and it builts up rupturing  /sacs/ inside the cells. The /sacs/ contains enzymes that begin to digest  the cells from inside out. This creates a blister-like fluid rich in nutrients. After about a week, the nutrients /fuel an/ army of bacteria and fungi that further liquefy the organ and muscle. The microbes that/ attack the tissue producing a bewildering array of more than 4 00 chemicals and gases. They include Freon, that's  right, the coolant found in refrigerators,  Benzene, a powerful component in gasline, sulfur, which smells in swamps and rotten eggs and the molecule known as  carbon tetrachloride which was used in fire extinguishers and dry cleaning until scientists  discovered it highly toxic. At this point, there is rarely little flesh left and is consumed by, here it comes, /maggots/ and beetles. Insects only leave bones behind. Overtime, the protein in bone decomposes too, leaving just the bone mineral called hydroxyapatite, which eventually turns into dust.

We can take some /solace/ in fact that all those nutrients and chemicals and even dust /provide/ vital substances that makes soils fertile, sprouting plants and other new life after our lives have ended. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

Paper cuts are usually small and shallow injuries, so why do they hurt so much? A close look at the /anatomy/ of our skin and the structure of paper, reveals a few explanations. We usually see paper cuts on our hands and fingers, where skin is packed with neurons. Some of these neurons called nociceptor detect potential harm. These cells response to high temperature,  harsh chemicals,  and any pressure that threatens to break the skin. Nociceptors trigger a cascade of electrical and chemicals signal that eventually reach the brain informing about the injury. In turn, our brain makes aware injury with the experience of pain. Also, a paper cut is not quite as clean as it looks. A paper edge may seem perfectly smooth but on the microscopic level, the edges are pretty jagged. A thin piece of paper cuts through skin is more like a saw than a knife, ripping apart our cell. And paper leaves behind chemicals coated particles, irritating the wood. Another thing, since paper cuts are generally shallow, they don't bleed or clot very much, that means damage tissues and neurons remain exposed, everytime we use our hands that wound flexes open, disturbing these neurons. 

Finally, we should also consider the psychology of paper cut. We tend to pay attention to a paper cut because it is on a body part we used so often. It's also surprising and kinda upsetting to be injured by something that seemingly benign  as paper.

It's all because your /hemoglobin/, the compound of your red blood cell that brings oxigen to your body. When you got hit, the /blow/ crashes tiny blood vessels called capillaries. Red blood cells /ooze out of /the broken capillaries into the surrounding tissue. From outside of your skin, the massive cells looks bluish black, which is where we get the term black and blue. Once /out of/ the capillaries, the red black cells no longer function. So other cells called /phagocytes/ move in to /mop up the debris. They /engulf the/ blood cells to stop them down. First, the /phagocytes/ break down the /hemoglobin/ into biliverdin, a kind of //bile. This turns the bruise green. Then the /phagocytes/ break down the biliverdin into bilirubin which is yellowish. Bilirubin is the waste we excrete/  and gives urine its yellow color.  Finally, the /phagocytes/ breaks down the bilirubin into hemosiderin, which is basically the iron that was in the hemoglobin. It is brownish and it is slowly absorbed into the body. The whole colorful process can typically take for two weeks. And sometimes, the bruise moves downwards, just because the gravity is pulling the debris in that direction. So next time you are showing off your nasty blue and black eye, and somebody says oh it's turning green. You can just say, hey it's my hemoglobin. Well, it used to be my hemoglobin.

Feel good lounging and doing nothing? Sometimes too good, whether to avoid work or escape physical activity, we have all had those days. But why are some people way lazier than others? Is there a couch potato gene that causes lazy behavior? Evolution has molded our brains and bodies to response positively to natural food, sex and even exercises. Wait, exercise? Yes, the pleasure we experience comes largely from dopamine system in our brain which conveys the messages throughout the body , ultimately helping to ensure our survival in our specis. For many, the pleasure  from the exercise become just as addictive as food and sex. But while we are all /up for/ more food and sex, many struggles for desire of physical activity, even though it's an essential part of human biology.

Scientists /studying mice/ found an interesting genetic connection after seperating mice to 2 groups. Those that chose to run on the wheel more often and those that decided not to run as much. The difference was clear in their offspring. After ten generations, the running mice were running on the wheels 75% more often than the other group. And by 16 generations, they were running 7 miles a day as oppsed to the other 4 miles. It seemed that their motion for physical activity was genetic. 

We all inherite genes from our parents that plays key role in the development of our brains and these genes can make some people literally /crave/ activity. In fact, the brains of the running mice have larger dopamine systems and the regions with motivation and reward. They needed activity, otherwise their brains will react to a similar drug addicted /rodents/ when deprived of cocain or nicotine. They are genetically addited to running. We also inherites genes responsible for our other traits from impulsivity to procrastination to /work ethic/ and straight up laziness. It makes out that our physical laziness may be linked to a couch potato gene. Or rather, a mutation in a normal gene which regulates activity levels.

Researchers /have known /for decades that meditation can improve someone's physical and mental health. It can relieve stress, lower the blood pressure and /lift/ someone's mood. But only the last ten years have neuronscientists take a serious look at the changes in the brains structure underlying some of meditation's benefits. Like anything  else we do, meditation rewires our neural circuits, pruning  away the least /used/ connections and strengthening the ones we exercise most. Studies looking for signs of these changes usually focu mindfulness meditation, which challenge people to keep their attention fixed on the thoughts, sensations in the present moment. Scientist acknowledge that many of these studies/ are small  and not ideally designed. 

But  at this point, researchers have gathered enough evidence to be confident that their findings are not just /flukes/. Experiments suggest that buddist monk  have really robust connections between scatter /regions/ of their brains, which allows for more synchronized communication. Expert meditators seem to also develop an especially  /wrinkly/ cortex, the brain's outer layer. We depend on the cortex on sophisticated mental abilities like abstract thought and introspection. 

Several studies have suggested meditation can increase the brain's volumn and density of hippocampus, a seahorse shape of the brain in the middle of the skull that is absolutely crutial for memory and althought the areas of the brain are responsible for sustaining attention, usually shrinks as we age, meditation conteracts this decay.

And increasing numbers of studies show that meditating for 12 to 20 minutes a day for several weeks can sharpen the mind. In these studies, meditator scored higher on attention and working memory, which is the ability to temporarily manipulation and  store the information in one's mind. Some lifelong meditators in 50s or 60s can even outperform on 20s somethings in test of visual attention.

The way we receive our electricity hasn't changed much in the last hundred of years. A coal or neuclear power plant sends electricity through transmission lines, to sub stations and onto transformers. Finer and finer wires of smaller voltages until the electricity reaches your laptop or iphone /plugged into/ the wall.  It's  just in time the manufacturing taken to the extreme. Since the electricity travel close to the speed of light, every kilowatt must be used instant it's created. For utility this means bouncy and heavy load, trying to match the electricity perfectly and nearly instantly with demand. When demand outpaces supply, everything goes dark. A black/ out/. 

/Since the spinning reserves, backup power plant that pumps electricity into the system as the moment notice. Keeping these plants online is the most expensive part on your  power bill and waste fuels like natural gas. Since the 1980s, the power grid has been getting smarter. Utilities began putting sensors in places that used a lot of electricity like factories. These sensors send realtime data of energy use, giving utilities hands up on the demand of the equation. As the sensors get cheaper and cheaper, like the internet of wireless communication become widespread, utilities are adding more and more sophisticated sensors to the grid. This means one thing, more information. This flood of data will be quickly parsed to locate power failures, reroute/ electricity or avoid overheating power lines.

That means utility companies can stop relying on gramma to let them know the power's out. It also means they can better deal with powerline failures  like the one that blacked out the northeastern US in 2003, Within the next  decades, sensors are likely to be everywhere, one type commonly known as the smartmeter will do the /home owners/ to the utilities of long done/ to factories. 2 /way communication/ utilities will give customers better information of who's using what, when. Could even let utilities do things like temporarily turn off a smart appliance in your home to avert a black out. That means utilities  can cut down on backup powerplants and also use reliable and cleaner electricity sources like wind turbines and solar cells. in the world needs energy to be cleaner, not just seems smart.

So why doesn't your gas seem half  as smelly as those around you?

But from an evolutionary persepctive, our reaction of disgust to other people's  odor is likely our brains' attempt to prevent us from doing harm to our bodies.
